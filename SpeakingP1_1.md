口语 Part 1

Where are you from?

I'm from Qingdao. (You know, it is a city in eastern Shandong Province on the east coast of China. Qingdao is the host city of sailing races of 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and of the 13th Paralympic Games, known as the Sailing City of China. It also won the reputations of the European-style city as "the Oriental Swiss".)

Are you a student or do you have a job?

I'm a student and I major in computer science. I've been studying this for one year already, so there're another three years to go before I graduate.

Do you live in a house or flat/apartment?

I live in a dormitory with three colleagues. It's not a very spacious one, but since it's only for us who lives there, it's big enough.


1. Work

1.1 Why did you choose to do that type of work?

I chose to go into computer science as my profession. The reason why I chose this type of work is that I have a real love of electronic circuits and programming. Therefore, I wanted to work in an area which would allow me to work around the things I prefer. Moreover, computer programming is a very stable job and can be quite lucrative in the long term, so I think it is a good idea for my future prospects.

1.2 Is it interesting?

Personally, I think it is a very interesting job. The reason why I believe this is I have access to many different and interesting knowledge throught the job, all of them are practical and related to daily life. Therefore, I find my job very exciting on some days. However. not every day is exciting and sometimes my job is mainly administration work and these days can be very boring.
