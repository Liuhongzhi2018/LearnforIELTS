# Lesson 5

口语 Part 1

Where are you from?

I'm from Qingdao. (You know, it is a city in eastern Shandong Province on the east coast of China. Qingdao is the host city of sailing races of 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and of the 13th Paralympic Games, known as the Sailing City of China. It also won the reputations of the European-style city as "the Oriental Swiss".)

Are you a student or do you have a job?

I'm a student and I major in computer science. I've been studying this for one year already, so there're another three years to go before I graduate.

Do you live in a house or flat/apartment?

I live in a dormitory with three colleagues. It's not a very spacious one, but since it's only for us who lives there, it's big enough.


1. Work

1.1 What work do you do?

I’m a electronics engineer for a state-owned enterprises that design circuits for television sets. So I need to do circuit analysis and design, as well as testing and debugging of the motherboard, in order to make our product work properly. 

1.2 Why did you choose to do that type of work (or that job)?

I chose to go into computer science as my profession. The reason why I chose this type of work is that I have a real love of electronic circuits and programming. Therefore, I wanted to work in an area which would allow me to work around the things I prefer. Moreover, computer programming is a very stable job and can be quite lucrative in the long term, so I think it is a good idea for my future prospects.

1.3 Is it very interesting?

Personally, I think it is a very interesting job. The reason why I believe this is I have access to many different and interesting knowledge throught the job, all of them are practical and related to daily life. Therefore, I find my job very exciting on some days. However. not every day is exciting and sometimes my job is mainly administration work and these days can be very boring.

1.4 Do you like your job?

I am very fond of my job. Actually engineer is more of a career instead of a job to me. Since I was a child, I always dreamed of being an engineer, designing electronic products that meet people's needs. I enjoy researching every day and translating the knowledge I've learnt over the past few years into products that meet people's needs. I have always had this feeling that I am energized and passionate as long as I am drilling into technology.

1.5 Do you miss being a student?

Honestly, I do enjoy sitting in the classroom and listening to the teacher, so yes, I miss being a student. Being a student is an enjoyable way for me to absorb knowledge. However, for now, I prefer being the one who is delivering knowledge because teaching is creating values and it's a way for me to pay back what I have learned during the past years.

1.6 What technology do you use at work?

Artificial intelligence helps automate mundane daily tasks and can save employees' time. Gmail automatically categorizes emails based on updates, promotions, social and purchases, which helps organize inboxes. Thanks to such categorization, employees can understand which section has important emails and they can also customize the incoming emails according to their categories. Cloud computing helps to store important files and data online which can be accessed in real time. Using such cloud services, employees can share data as and when they need it and update it remotely. Such an alternative is more secure and user-friendly than traditional paper and pencil or software methods.


1.7 Who helps you the most? And how?

My first leader helped me the most when I first entered the workforce. He was the director of the institute, guided me on the need to learn professional knowledge, gave us new employees enough room to play, and was my role model and guide at work.
