# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

31.    Advertisement

31.1 Are you interested in watching TV advertisements or internet advertisements?

I give more preference to the internet as compared to television. I rarely watch TV, so most of the ads that I see are on the internet while surfing youtube videos or any other website.

31.2 What kinds of advertisements do you dislike?

Actually, I really hate some intrusive ones, because I think these days we are bombarded with adverts, and I see those disturbing adverts on my social media feeds, sometimes the website pop ups, or junk mails. They are just wasting my time when I have to close or just delete them.


31.3 Do you share advertisements with others?

Well, yes, some adverts that tell a story can be quite engaging, like the other day, I just saw the Burger king commercial, it is something that I've never seen before, it tells a story how people just ignore bully in this place, so the staff just smash the burger, which is called bullied burger. Of course, those people complain about this burger, and after this scenario, some people tend to stop. The bully, well, I got to say, it is brilliant, rather than focusing on the product features, they are using Powerful emotional connection.

31.4 Do you want to work in advertising in the future?

That is really an interesting question, isn't it? I would say probably not, first, it is not something that I am interested in. So, I'd better do something that I am good at, you know, such as teaching English; and besides, considering the sunk cost, even if I were interested in advertising, it is something i would not do in the future.
