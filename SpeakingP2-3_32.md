Part 2

32.    Describe a positive change that you made in your life. 

You should say:
What it is
Why you did it
Who you did it with
And explain how you feel about the change

I'm sure we as people bring in positive and negative changes to our lives now and then, but let me elaborate on one that changed my life completely.

The first time I migrated to a different state, after completing my education, five years ago. Initially, I was thrilled to experience a new culture and make new friends. Very soon, I realized that I was going to be all by myself. Since I have lived an overprotective life in a shell, it was difficult to become independent for me out of the blue.

Right from cooking to cleaning, running my errands, doing laundry, driving, and forgetting that I went there to work. I was absolutely terrified to be living on my own. I had never lived such a life because I lived with my family, and chores were equally divided amongst us. However, I realized that it was for my good, and it changed me as a person as time passed by.

I became independent, confident, more aware of things going around me like grocery or fuel prices and learning how to fix the car. I am so grateful for that opportunity in my life, or else I’d still be in a cocoon.


Part 3

32.1. Is it easier for young people to change?

I’s say that young people are more likely to embrace change than their old counterparts. This is mainly because change involves a certain level of risks and obviously youngsters are more willing to take risks. 

Young people have the ideas, the creativity and great energy to shape a better world. Young people are full of hope and through innovation and imagination. They are problem solvers and have a great potential to generate a positive social change in the world.

Young people have nothing to lose. They have no mortgage or credit card debts to repay, no family to support, and no career to leave. They have no reason not to risk 'everything' they have on an ambitious campaign or dreamt-up rganisation.


32.2. Is it easy for old people to change?

The elderly are often unable to adjust to new surroundings because of the deterioration of a brain circuit which plays a critical role in goal-directing learning. Flexibility issues in ageing have long been described in other navigation and spatial memory tasks. 

As you get older, your social circles will probably be more limited and stable than when you were younger. Therefore, you'll probably be exposed less often to ideas that might be radically different and that would challenge your own.
Older people tend to have more routines, and stray less from those routines.

32.3. How can people change their daily routine if they want to?

It is necessary to be realistic. Our 'perfect day' must account for our current circumstances and capacity. One thing to keep in mind is that most things will probably take longer than we expect, which is the reason to keep our expectations and goals on the lower side while we implementing changes.

If too much change at once completely throws you off, it’s okay to make small changes over time. Supporting idea: In fact, small little swaps in our routine can help us make those changes into habits faster than it will take us to adapt to large sweeping changes.

32.4. What are the disadvantages when people keep making changes?

In order to progress we need to improve, and improvement means change. The dynamics of our modern life have changed dramatically, and in order to adapt, methodologies, processes, and products must be adjusted to the changing environment. Readiness to change guarantees flexibility of our competitiveness.

The efficiency and productivity of the organization are increased, facilitating the achievement of the organization’s goals and mission. Individual and group morale are improved and there is an overall sense of cohesion and well-being.
