# Lesson 6

口语 Part 1

2. Study

2.1 What subjects are you studying?

There are two parts of my studies, integrated circuit design and code programming. As for the former, we mainly focus on the optimization of digital logic in digital integrated circuits, netlist implementation, writing of register transfer level hardware description language code, verification, simulation and timing analysis of logic functions, distribution of circuits in hardware, placement of operational amplifiers, electronic filters and other devices in analog integrated circuits and mixed signal processing. For the latter, we study the process of making a computer solve a problem by writing code, specifying a certain operation method for a certain computing system, so that the computing system runs according to the computing method, and finally obtains the corresponding result.

2.2 Why did you choose that subject?

When I was applying for universities, I chose to study integrated circuit design and code programming. I chose to learn them because when I was young, I had a strong passion for both electronic circuit and coding so I wanted to develop my design skills. I would like to develop a career around circuit design and computer programming so a good understanding of its composition principle and development will be very useful for my future. For those reasons I thought integrated circuit design and code programming are good choices for me to study.
