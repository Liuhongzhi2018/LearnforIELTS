# Lesson 6

口语 Part 1

2. Study

2.1 What subjects are you studying?

There are two parts of my studies, integrated circuit design and code programming. As for the former, we mainly focus on the optimization of digital logic in digital integrated circuits, netlist implementation, writing of register transfer level hardware description language code, verification, simulation and timing analysis of logic functions, distribution of circuits in hardware, placement of operational amplifiers, electronic filters and other devices in analog integrated circuits and mixed signal processing. For the latter, we study the process of making a computer solve a problem by writing code, specifying a certain operation method for a certain computing system, so that the computing system runs according to the computing method, and finally obtains the corresponding result.

2.2 Do you like your subject?

Yes, I do. Well, actually as for me I think I am really like electrical engineering. I think that it is the truth that the electrical engineer would have a bright future and a great salary in the future, I think that by learning the knowledge of the electrical it would be very useful in our daily life. Not only the teacher teach me a lot of lessons but also they would give us lots of practical class and experiment to let us learn how electricity works.

2.3 Why did you choose to study that subject?

When I was applying for universities, I chose to study integrated circuit design and code programming. I chose to learn them because when I was young, I had a strong passion for both electronic circuit and coding so I wanted to develop my design skills. I would like to develop a career around circuit design and computer programming so a good understanding of its composition principle and development will be very useful for my future. For those reasons I thought integrated circuit design and code programming are good choices for me to study.

2.4 Is it very interesting?

Yes, it is the most interesting subject from my perspective as it provides us information about everything around us, living and nonliving. Studying science helps to understand the world conceptually.

2.5 Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?

I would study best in the morning, which i believe most people usually do, as we are the most lively and active in the morning. I would absorb the most in the morning. I am usually tired in the afternoon and would take a nap just an hour before dinner. After dinner, maybe would do an hour of leisure or two, then its time to cool down and study again, if in the mood.

2.6 Are you looking forward to working?

Oh, definitely. I'm eager to work. The main reason is that I can have my own independent income. Even if it's just an entry-level job with minimum wage, I will be happy to be able to spend money on the things I really want.

2.7 What technology do you use when you study?

There are lots of websites and apps that can quiz you and test your knowledge. All you have to do is input your terms and then you can use online flashcards. I've used a couple of them to memorize important terms before an exam. They're definitely a life-saver when you're in a rush to catch up on some class content.
