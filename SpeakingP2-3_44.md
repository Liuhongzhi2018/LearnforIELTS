Part 2

44.   Describe a way / change that helps you save a lot of time. 

You should say:
What it is
How you implement it
How it helps you save time
And explain how you feel about the way/change

The change I am going to tell you about is that I bought a bicycle which significantly reduces the time I spend on my commute.My university is a huge one.Although I live right on the campus,it still took me over 40 minutes to walk to and from the teaching building.Considering that I needed to do this at least two times a day,a lot of time was wasted on the road.

Then one day,when I was waiting for my friends at the east gate,I noticed that the communication company had set up a stall by the street with a hoarding saying that as long as you topped up 500 RMB,you would get a foldable bicycle for free.I was attracted.After some consultation and confirmation,I paid the money and got a bicycle in return.

It was a tiny,green one,with the company’s logo on the basket.In fact,you might mistake it as a toy for teenagers,and I had to admit that it was far inferior to those high-end ones.But it was functional,and that was enough.With it,my commuting time decreased from 40 minutes to merely 10 minutes,leaving me more time to sleep,enjoy a decent breakfast,and complete my homework.

I feel pleased and lucky with this change.If I had not seen the stall,I might stick to walking for another year until I could no longer put up with it.

Part 3

44.1. What can people do to save time?

Saving time can be done in many ways, from studying to working. When it comes to study, people can use techniques like spaced-repetition to remember vocabulary faster. Or when you work, you should work in a team, or ask for help when stuck instead of trying to solve the problem vainly alone. For example, when I teach English, instead of designing all the slides on my own, I’d try to find sources that provide materials or platforms that provide completed designs so I just need to fill my questions in.

Creating and following a routine is the number one way to save time in daily life. This is because daily routine simplifies work and eliminates delay.
It is vital to prepare our day-to-day working schedules with a time frame and prioritize works based on their length, complexity, and necessity.

By keeping track of your time, we can be aware of time while doing something, and not waste it on trivial matters. As a saying goes "When gets measured gets done". If you manage your time well, you can unwind and spend time with friends and family.

44.2. Does technology help people save time? How and why?

Of course, it does. Being tech savvy can help save much time. For students, studying online is like the norm nowadays, they can just attend a class from the comfort of their own home, with a few clicks. Normally, I’d take them time to put on clothes and get to school, but not anymore. The same can be done for virtual conferences in companies. Apps like Zoom or Google Meet are the game changers.

44.3. Do you think parents should be responsible for teaching children to save time?

Yes I do, time management is a vital skill for all of us, including kids. If they can take up this skill from an early age, they can be more productive and disciplined later on. A very effective way to do this is to get your kids to create their own daily/ weekly or even monthly schedule.

44.4. Do people who can manage time well become successful more easily?

Not exactly but I definitely believe that people’d have a better chance of being successful if they manage their time well. The reason for this is that if you manage your time well, you can be more productive, either at work or school. And more work finished means more results! I mean you can look at all the successful people around the world and 99% of them know how to manage their time.
