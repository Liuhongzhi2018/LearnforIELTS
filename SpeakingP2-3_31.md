Part 2

31.   Describe a popular / well-known person in your country. 

You should say:
Who this person is
What he/she has done
Why he/she is popular
And explain how you feel about this person

The famous person I am going to tell you about is Li Ning,a retired Chinese gymnast,billionaire entrepreneur,and the founder of the eponymous sportswear company Li-Ning.He was also the final torch relay runner at the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing and ignited the cauldron in the Bird’s Nest stadium.

I first heard about his name when I watched a gymnastics competition with my father.After seeing the Chinese athlete make a mistake in the rings and lose the medal,he said nothing like this would happen if Li Ning were on the court.He then told me about his glorious career.In 1982,he won six of the seven medals awarded at the sixth World Cup Gymnastic Competition,earning him the title “Prince of Gymnastics.”He then procured six medals again at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

His legend continues after he retired from competition in the 1980s.He founded a company in his own name,selling sports footwear,apparel,and accessories.After thirty years of development,his firm has grown into one of China’s most prominent sports goods manufacturers and directly competes with international brands like Nike and Adidas.He has sponsored a wide range of Chinese sports games,both renowned and unknown ones,and employed many retired athletes to guarantee their basic life needs.

I admire him because of his unparalleled achievement as an athlete and a businessman.Until now,no other gymnast’s accomplishment can match his record,let alone achieve success in the competitive business world.

Part 3

31.1. What kinds of people are popular at work?

Doers are popular at work who keep the workflow of any project running smoothly. They usually don't talk to you a lot but don't take it as they don't like you. The fact is, they don't talk too much to anybody. Their moment of glory is always the time when they bring their results on time and this is the way they show you some affection. Having a doer in a working group brings a lot of certainty in. They also inspire others to finish their assignment. So, if you are the type of person who has some difficulties finishing things up, try to stick with doers and your results will improve rapidly.

31.2. Are bosses more popular than employees at work?

The boss is usually the role of giving orders, dominating the work and making people feel pressure. But employees are the main body in the work, the role of concrete implementation, which decides whether the work can be completed successfully. Therefore employees are more popular than bosses.

31.3. Which one is more important, keeping a good relationship with colleagues or doing well at work?

On the one hand, having relationships with your peers can have a direct impact on our professional success. Coworkers who have positive relationships with one another are more likely to perform well when working together on a project. Collaboration among team members typically results in less ambiguity in communication, and everyone is more clear on exactly what their specific tasks are.

On the other hand, effective workers get exciting projects, win important clients, and are well respected by their colleagues and bosses. Being truly effective at work can pay off now and throughout our careers. Effective workers are often the most respected and the most productive in their workplaces, and they're often the first to be considered for a promotion. 

31.4. What benefits are there when a child is popular at school?

A student who is popular on his or her own merits is generally a happy, well-adjusted individual. These students are friendly, talk to everyone, do well with academics and set a good example. Their peers look up to them because they are admired for their positive traits. These students will be more well liked by most of their peers.
