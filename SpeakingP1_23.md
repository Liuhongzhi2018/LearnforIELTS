23.   Books and reading habits

23.1  Do you often read book? When? 

Um not really. Reading is very time consuming and I need a comparatively quiet place to read. So you know it’s not easy to have such a condition for me like have a long period of time as well as a quiet environment. Um yeah hopefully I could read more in the future.


23.2  Are you reading habits now different than before? 

Sure I enjoyed comic books a lot when I was young because they’re very romantic
and funny to read. But now I'm more into historic books and classic literature because they talk deeply into the reality.

23.3  Have you ever read a novel that has been adapted into a film? 

Well I would say the opposite. I read the novel after I watched a movie, like the one called call me by your name. I really liked the movie a lot I liked it so much that I bought the novel afterwards, but I still think the movie is more tasteful.

23.4  Which do you prefer, reading books or watching moives? 

Well it depends. If it’s something like comedy or documentary, I would definitely
go for the movies because they’re more vivid and it’s just funnier to see the real thing. However, if it’s something about history, I would read the books because there are more details in the book, and you know the movie can never go back to shoot the real thing.
