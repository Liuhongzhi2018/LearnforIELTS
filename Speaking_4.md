3. Weather

3.1 what kind of weather do you like most?

My favourite kind of weather would definitely be a warm spring afternoon with a light breeze. I like weather that is temperate and mild, the kind of weather you can lay down in and relax. I perfer such weather to wind, rain and snow. Because I like to spend my time outdoors and there kinds of weather prevent me from doing that.


3.2 Do you prefer dry or wet weather?

I prefer the wet weather. In my hometown, the weather is pretty wet, and it always rains in summer. So I think I've adapted to this climate. So being hot and humid weather does not bother me and it means that I can appreciate the beauty of rain and the lovely sound it makes. Furthermore, dry weather can also be often unbearable which I do not like. 


3.3 What's the weather like where you live?

Where I live has pretty consistent weather. It’s usually warm in the summer and cold in the winter. Sometimes there can be dry spells, but we get a normal amount of rain and snow. I like that we go through all the seasons. It’s nice to have a change every once in a while .

3.4 Do you prefer cold or hot weather?

My favorite season is winter. I usually enjoy snowflakes and play snowballs. I like to take a hot spring bath or make a massage in winter. Well, that would be fantastic! Summer sucks here because of the stupid hot weather; you can't play sports without sweating buckets.

3.5 Do you think the weather can affect people's moods?

Yeah it definitely can. Some people have a thing called seasonal depression where for example, during the winter months they are depressed throughout that whole period but they get better when spring comes along.
