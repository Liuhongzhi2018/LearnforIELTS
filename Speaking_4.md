# Lesson 4

## P2 回答策略

逐点回答：从上到下，一点一点回答，不要串点，不一定需要涵盖所有点

做除法：2分钟，12-15句话， 每点有3-4句话

P2 = 4 × P1

Describe an old person you know who you respect
You should say：
Who the person is
How you know the person
What this person is like
And explain why you respect him or her.

The person I really respect is my grandfather. He’s in his early 70s, but he doesn't seem old at all. （原因）I think it's （1）primarily because he is extremely energetic every single day. （原因/表现）You know, he goes for a run every morning in the park, and sometimes he goes fishing with his old pals. （2）Plus, my granddad is a really hilarious guy and （表现）he tells many jokes. （结果）Whenever I hang out
with him, he always cracks me up.

My grandfather is my role model and I really look up to him cause （1）for starters, he is a glass half full kind of guy. He is always positive and it seems like nothing bothers him. （举例/回顾过去） Just to give you an example, a couple of weeks ago, he asked me to go fishing with him and I agreed. But just as we were about to set out, it began to rain. I was really bummed out. But my granddad said, “It's okay, let's play chess instead”. Then, we began to look for our chess board and it was nowhere to be found. Even after this, he was still smiling. At the same time, he was scratching his head, saying, “I must have left it in the park”. （2）Um another reason I really respect him is because he admits he’s wrong whenever he's made a mistake. You know, it's not easy for elderly people. （原因）Most of them think saying “I'm wrong” makes them lose face. But my granddad is not one of them ...

## 如何扩展？

1. 前因后果、逻辑递推
2. 多给细节、多举例子：数字+列举+宽泛到具体+举例
3. 回顾过去（最简单、最有效）: 在某一点或某些点中讲一个曾经的故事（时间、地点、人物、事件、感受，注意讲故事时的“细节描述+时间顺序”）

For example, ... / For instance, ... / I remember
(vividly/clearly) ... / Actually, last year ... / You know, two
months ago ... / Like last week...

what you did at the party
why you enjoy traveling with friends
what you can learn from the program
what you can do with this app

4. 平行扩展+黄金“三”原则：有些“点”可以给出三个“观点”
what you often do together/what the book is about/what you liked about the city/why he or she is famous

Well, there are a couple of reasons why I went there. First of all ... Plus ... Also
Well, there are loads/tons of things we often do together....
For starters ... Also ... Besides ...
Um, I think she is extremely famous across the world primarily because ... Another reason is ... Apart from that ...

词汇：30大习语+充分模仿我的sample answers+词汇逆袭法
语法：平时录音练习、听、改错，把答案写下来——200字左右，写完后读两三遍，然后做笔记、练习回答两三遍

在考场上，不要被自己准备过的东西所牵绊，忘了就按照大概思路自己扩展一点没的说了，别紧张，去说下一点
