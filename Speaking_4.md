3. Weather

3.1 what kind of weather do you like most?

My favourite kind of weather would definitely be a warm spring afternoon with a light breeze. I like weather that is temperate and mild, the kind of weather you can lay down in and relax. I perfer such weather to wind, rain and snow. Because I like to spend my time outdoors and there kinds of weather prevent me from doing that.
