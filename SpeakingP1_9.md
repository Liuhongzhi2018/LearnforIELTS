# Lesson 13

口语 Part 1

1. Geography

9.1  Do you like geography?

Yeah, I love geography because it gives me the chance to have a look at the places I've never been to. It's amazing. And this subject also explains how different islands and volcanoes form and things like that. It has solved tons of mysteries, which is really like an eye-opener.

Nope, geography is just not my thing. I find it boring because it is an isolated subject. But when I travel to a new place, I sometimes feel the importance of knowing a bit geography.

9.2 Have you ever studied geography at school?

Well, geography was a compulsory subject at my primary school, so I think I started to learn it in Grade 2. I have learned both national geography and world geography. I just remember that at that time there were a great deal of names to memorise, the mountains, the rivers and etc, not a pleasant experience for me.

9.3 Are you good at reading a map?

I'm skillful in reading the paper map. It's because I'm awful at directions and reading the map is really doing my head in. But I should say, the navigation app in the smartphone is my savior. You know, it shows my starting point, the route and even the arrival time, so it helps me to find the places everywhere I go.

9.4 Would you visit a country because of its geographical location?

Yeah, I'm always curious about the places I'm not very familiar with and the special geographical location makes it more mysterious. And Egypt must be the one. The desert there is so impressive. And apart from that, if I go to the country near the sea like Thailand, then I just have the chance to taste the local delicacy.

Actually, the other day while I was doing the IELTS reading practice, I happened to read an article about geoglyphs in England, and it did arouse my interest in these places. These geoglyphs have been there for more than 3000 years, very amazing, I would like to have a look at them myself.
