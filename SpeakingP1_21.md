21.  Doing sports

21.1  What sports do you like?

I prefer to do moderate exercise instead of vigorous exercise. For example, I like walking, jogging, cycling and playing badminton.

Well, I enjoy going for bike rides with my friends at the weekend. We normally cycle for about two or three hours.

21.2  Where did you learn how to do it?

I teach myself. I have never received formal training, like signing up for a course or finding a coach. initially, I learned how to play badminton from my classmate back in high school. He taught me basic skills, like how to hold and swing the bat.

In the park, my dad taught me how to ride a bike. At first, I was nervous. I always felt that I would fall down from my bike. My father encouraged me to be brave. And he would help me and protect me. Then I was not so worried. I could ride it slowly.

21.3  Did you do some sports when you were young?

Yes, I did. When I was young I mainly played football and basketball, and took part in school physical education – like ball control games and things like this. I love sport, especially team sports and competitive sports, moreso than running or jogging and individual sports, I’d say.

Well, when I was ten years old, I always played football with my friends after school. At weekends, it took me two hours to play football, because I think play football can make me healthy and strong.

21.4  Do you think students need more exercise?

Yes, of course. As is known, to have a sound mind, people must first have a sound body. To keep students fit, physical exercise is the best way. Only 17by keeping them healthy and strong can they feel energetic and vigorous in studying and live a happy life.
