Part 2

1.  Describe something you had to share with others. 

You should say:
What it was
Who you shared it with
Why you had to share it with others
And explain how you felt about it

Two years back, I shared my laptop with my younger cousin. In 2020,  the world experienced a lockdown due to the coronavirus. For a sizeable part of the year, we remained indoors in the comfort of our homes. During that time, my cousin joined an online class on digital marketing. He attended the first few classes through his smartphone and found it challenging to do practical work on the phone. He asked my mother for a new laptop, but due to the lockdown, it was not viable for us to buy it from outside because the shops were closed. Without exception, I had no option but to share my laptop with my younger cousin. Every day I used to give it to him for 5 hours.  The availability of a laptop enhanced my cousin's performance, and he managed to learn digital marketing in two months.  As for how I felt about it, well, initially, I was upset because my work and study suffered a lot. But later on, I managed it because I started doing other work while my laptop was busy with my cousin. I started spending six hours without a laptop by doing a physical workout, watching motivational videos on TV and cooking my favorite mouth-watering delicacies. And upon finishing his classes, my younger cousin treated me to a cup of Starbuck's to express his thanks for my generous help. So that felt not bad. The sharing kinda helped me to strengthen the bond with my younger cousin.

Part 3

3.1 Do you think kids like to share? Why?

No, I don't think so. Firstly, Children are seldom capable of true empathy under the age of six. The power to possess is a natural part of the child’s growing awareness. The concepts of sharing, lending, and borrowing are too complex for young kids to understand. Toddlers have not yet developed empathy and cannot see things from another child's perspective.

3.2 How can parents teach their children to share?

Parents can encourage children to share with one another from a young age. From exchanging toys to taking turns on the playground, sharing is an important skill to master in early childhood. 

3.3 What do you think is the benefit of sharing for children?

Children need to learn to share so they can make and keep friends, play cooperatively, take turns, negotiate and cope with disappointment. Sharing teaches children about compromise and fairness. They learn that if we give a little to others, we can get some of what we want too.

3.4 Is there anything that parents should persuade children to share with others?

No, there isn't. Parents should not persuade children to share. Instead, create attitudes and an environment that encourages your child to want to share. There is power in possession. To you, they’re only toys. To a child, they’re a valuable, prized collection that has taken years to assemble.
