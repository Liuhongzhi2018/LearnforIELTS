## reason for study

The bar charts compare students of different ages in terms of what motivates them to study and the support they received from employers.

Young people study primarily to further their careers, with up to 80% of those under the age of 26 studying for this purpose. This figure is significantly higher than the proportion of those study out of personal interest. The gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those aged 40 to 49 are the same. Students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest, rather than for career.

Around 60% of students aged under 26 received support from employers for further education. The figure drops steadily with age, and only one third of those 30-to-39-year-old students are support by employers. In contrast, older students, namely, those in their forties and those aged 50 or more, are more likely to gain support.

Overall, younger students are more likely to study for carer purposed, while their older counterparts are more motivated by personal interest. Employers give more support to young students than to employees of other ages.
