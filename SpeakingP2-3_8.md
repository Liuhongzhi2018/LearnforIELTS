Part 2

8.  Describe a person you know who is from a different culture. 

You should say:
Who he/she is
Where he/she is from
How you knew him/her
And explain how you feel about him/her

Well, it is not uncommon these days for people to make friends from different cultures and the credit goes to globalisation and improved technology as there are no geographical boundaries today. 

I have made many friends who are from different cultures but one I would like to talk about here is jason. Jason is an American and I found him on a chatting platform where one day I was trying to find an English-speaking person to chat to and this is something I often do to improve my English ability.

We become friends in no time. The fact is that Jason is equally interested to travel in India. So, during this chat, he asked me many things about India and the places to visit in India.

Now, we have become good friends and we frequently chay during this time, chatting with Jason I got to learn a lot about American culture. For example, I have learnt that he is only 18 and he is planning to travel to India alone.

He gives more importance to money rather than giving to family, friends or society which is not in my country at all. But I think that culture diversity is what develops your curiosity to learn about different cultures.



Part 3

8.1 Where and how can we get to know people of different cultures better?

I think social platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram are great ways to interact/connect with people from different cultures. Here people from different cultures can discuss like-minded ideas and interests. However, the traditional way to learn about a different culture would be to read books related to it, watch movies, or may be travel to that place.

8.2 What are the advantages and disadvantages of cultural diversity?

If I talk about advantages, cultural diversity makes our world more interesting. If there was only one culture in the world, it would have been a really boring place. Cultural diversity acts as a change that makes people curious about each other. Also, people get to learn a lot from each other’s cultures. However, from a disadvantage point of view, cultural diversity can sometimes create a divide amongst people. People of one culture might believe themselves to be superior as compared to others and it can lead to hate and difference among them.

8.3 How can traditional culture and other cultures coexist?

For different cultures to co-exist together, especially traditional and modern, it requires a lot of effort from the members of the society. Followers of both cultures should show respect and understanding for each other and should not indulge in any activities that could hurt each other’s sentiments. Also, I feel that the generation gap plays a huge role in traditional and modern culture, and narrowing it down can help both cultures to co-exist peacefully.

8.4 Which Chinese traditions are disappearing?

China's most important traditional festival, Spring Festival, has produced numerous folk customs. But in China's rush for development old ways are being neglected. Only some traditions remain, and some are disappearing, such as offering sacrifices to the god of the kitchen stove, opening-door firecrackers on Chinese New Year morning and no using of brooms on Chinese New Year's day.
