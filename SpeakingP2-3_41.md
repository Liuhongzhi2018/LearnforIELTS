Part 2

41.   Describe an interesting neighbor. 

You should say:
Who he/she is
How you knew him/her
What you do together
And explain why he/she is interesting

Mr.X is one of the neighbours whom I like very much. Since I live in an urban area, people are close to each other and maintain a strong neighbourhood relationship, unlike the metropolitan areas.

In our neighborhood, we know almost each and every person living there, what they do, what are their updates, what are their profession and their overall personality and characteristics as well. Mr John’s house is adjacent to ours and I meet him almost every day. Mr John is a retired army person who is now around 50 years old.

He lives in his house alone and I have never found his relatives visiting him except some old colleagues. He stays inside his house most of the time and in the evening he sits on the veranda. He is a quiet man and likes to read a lot. I have seen him coming to live in his house almost 5-6 years ago. He bought the house from our previous neighbour.

I have had several conversations with him and I often play chess with him. I like to read as well and our reading habit was the primary reason we started liking to accompany each other. I like and admire this man very much. Though at first impression he seems to be an arrogant person, in reality, he is an intelligent, calm, good-hearted and charming man.

I have heard lots of stories from him. He has travelled to many different places and has lots of experience. Since I have become close to him, he recommends books to me which I mostly enjoy reading. He advises me whenever I seek his guidance. He is sometimes a close friend, sometimes a mentor and sometimes a guardian. I like him because of our unclaimed friendship, his personality, honesty, morality and his great mind.

Part 3

41.1. Do you think people are familiar with their neighbors?

I think most people are not familiar with their neighbors. As employment opportunities and the cost of living have increased significantly over the last decade, there are an increasing number of people who are occupied with working. So people have less time for human interaction. Another reason is that people’s favorite pastime nowadays seems to be scrolling through their smartphones, rather than interacting with their neighbors. In my neighborhood, the scene of children gathering in the street and playing traditional folk games is less common compared to when I was young.

41.2. How can people improve the relationship with neighbors in a community?

There are many ways you can do to have a better relationship with your neighbors. For example, try to be friendly. When running into your neighbors, you can wave, smile, say hi, or even have small talk with them. Another way is to offer a hand when you see your neighbors struggling. For example, helping a neighbor carry something heavy or take in their laundry when raining can be small yet effective gestures to improve neighbor relationships. Being respectful is also critical when it comes to building a strong relationship. For example, you should say thank you and sorry whenever necessary, and avoid causing any inconvenience such as opening music too loudly or littering in public spaces.

41.3. How do children build relationships with others in a community?

Parents can create opportunities for their child to meet with people in their community. They can take their child to community events, such as local volunteering, festivals and fitness programs, and public spaces, like parks and squares, to meet and play with other children and parents. Also, children nowadays spend less time outdoors playing with the neighbor kids because they would rather stay at home scrolling through their phones. So in order to facilitate community connections and friendships for children in the community, parents should limit their sons or daughters’ screen time.

41.4. Is it beneficial to get along well with neighbors?

Absolutely. If you have good relationships with your neighbors, your lives can be peaceful and comfortable. It is because the neighbors may be reluctant and think twice before doing anything that can cause inconvenience to you if they are your friends; they may be less likely to be loud and rowdy, or litter in front of your house. There will be less conflict too. Also, neighbors who are on good terms with you are more willing to help and watch out for you, as well as your property when you are not around. This is a major benefit as modern people tend to live far away from their families, which makes it easier for them to reach their neighbors for help than their families.
