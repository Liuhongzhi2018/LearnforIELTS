Part 2

38.   Describe a time you were very busy. 

You should say:
When it happened
Where you were
What you did
And explain why you were busy

We all happen to be industrious about certain tasks and errands from time to time. During such situations, we tend to overlook every other aspect of our lives and focus all of our attention on the task at hand. The reason behind such concentrated efforts can vary from person to person. A similar time when I was quite busy myself was when I was volunteering for my annual college fest.

It was at the end of 2018, and our first year of college was coming to an end. Most of our batchmates were either hosting an event or volunteering and supervising various activities. I was appointed as the volunteer for all the academic events on an entire floor of my college campus. Thus, I had quite a lot on my plate and was caught up with various supervision activities.

A major part of my role as a volunteer was to resolve any issues that occurred on the floor that I was supervising. If a particular host or participant faced any problems, they could come to me to have their questions answered and issues resolved. Needless to say, I was approached by a number of participants who asked me questions about the events, registration procedures and other incidental details about the fest.

There were times when the hosts of a few events asked me for advice on how to tackle certain problems during their events. Despite having a bustling schedule, I managed to handle my responsibilities well by properly allocating time to each issue that arose. The college fest was a huge success, and I had a wonderful experience volunteering for the event.

Part 3

38.1. Are you often busy?

Actually, my job is flexible. Sometimes I have my hands full, especially when I am assigned new tasks by the boss. I am busy as a beaver and spend several weeks working overtime. But after I finish my work, I can have a lot of free time to unwind.
That is why I like my job very much.

38.2. What are the advantages and disadvantages when people keep busy?

When it comes to the positive sides, I think people who keep busy can learn how to manage their time, stay organized and work efficiently. Apart from that, they will never feel bored as they are on the go all the time. However, if they are always busy, they probably feel tired and exhausted. Also, keeping busy may result in stress, anxiety, or illness.

38.3. Do you think children should learn through playing games or under pressure?

In my view, it will be better if children learn through playing games. During this process, children can practise what they know, and also what they don’t. It allows them to experiment through trial and error, find solutions to problems, work out the best strategies, and build new confidence and skills. As children don’t have enough knowledge to deal with pressure, they will probably get bored if they study in a stressful environment.

38.4. What kind of pressure people may experience at work?

There is a wide variety of stress that people may experience at work. Some work-related pressure includes long hours, heavy workload or job insecurity. Some people have conflicts with co- workers or bosses and feel stressed. Besides, meeting the deadline or achieving the goals is another kind of pressure, especially among people who are ambitious or have high self- expectation.
