Part 2

29.    Describe an invention that has changed the world in a positive way. 

You should say:
What it is
What benefits it has brought
How it influences people of different ages
And explain how it changed people's lives

The past few years have been the golden era of advanced technology, and I suppose household appliances are no exception. I'm going to describe the refrigerator as a household equipment that I find most useful for my family.

My mom loves cooking and she's actually a good cook. She's mainly responsible for shopping for healthy food and cooking scrumptious meals for all of us. And as a matter of fact, our refrigerator is essential when it comes to food storage. Its size is perfect for the corner area in our kitchen, yet big enough to store a large amount of food for the whole family. We keep the vegetables and certain kinds of fruits at the bottom, whereas the leftovers are kept on top. And some cakes that are made by my mom are kept cold in the middle.

As regards my family meals, fresh meat and seafood is a must. In particular I cannot go a day without a single piece of pork or beef. Thus, the fridge has always done a great job of keeping the meat and seafood fresh all the time. Besides, ice cream bought by my dad every two to three weeks is also stored in the same freezer.

Refrigerator is a wonderful technological invention I must say. It is an indispensable appliance for almost every household. Since the country possesses tropical weather and particularly quite high outside temperature these days, it is difficult to keep the vegetables or meat fresh even for a few days. I think down the line if I ever move away, the fridge is definitely on top of my must-have list.

Part 3

29.1. What is the most helpful innovation at home?

Personally speaking, the most helpful innovation at home is still light bulbs. So many years ago, when my grandfather and grandmother married, the only electric device they possess is a flashlight.

I think digital light is the most helpful innovation at home. With a simple click of a remote, you can bathe your house in pretty much any color you want. At the center of this technology is the LED (light-emitting diode) bulb. LEDs allow you to pick the color and brightness of light. In addition, LED lights save money because they use less energy than regular bulbs. 

29.2. What household appliances make us lazy?

There is no doubt that TVs, computers and routers make us lazy, for TVs and computers show us interesting things, which make us sticked in front of them, while routers allow smart devices attached to the Internet, and involve all family members to stay connected.

29.3. What kind of invention can be used at school?

As for middle school students, all above should not be used at school, or under supervision. But in colleges, you can use all kinds of inventions above.

29.4. Do you think AI will replace human teachers? Why?

I don't agree AI will replace human teachers, at least, until the time I passed away. AIs may have a long way to go if they want to replace human teachers, translators, writers for there are no such things like emotion in AIs, for this is the most important thing for those vacations.
