# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

16.   Names 

16.1  Does your name have any special meaning?

In my name, Hong means "swan goose", which means that my parents want me to have great ambitions, and Zhi means "wisdom and intelligence", which means that I should be knowledgeable and full of wisdom. I like my name because it's unique and I have never met anyone whose name is the name as mine.

16.2  How would you choose names for your next generation?

Well, some people may ask some experts who are professional at name-choosing to do it, while some just open the Chinese dictionary and seek for the characters that either are beautifully pronounced or have special meanings.

16.3 Are there any differences between how Chinese name their children how and in the past?

Sure. In the past, the second character of Chinese people's names may be fixed and the same as their siblings, just to show their seniority in a family. But now parents just tend to pick whichever characters they want without many limitations.

16.4 Does anyone in your family have the same name as you?

Certainly no. It's almost impossible to find a person who has the same name as us in a Chinese family. Unlike the culture in western countries, where naming the children the same names as their grandparents may be a way to show respect and love to them, the Chinese may even try their best to avoid choosing the same one.


16.5 Are their any names that are more poppular than others in China?

Yes there are. They are really depend because different people have different tastes. But I guess for the majority of people, they prefer to use 'xue' which means snow in English for girls and prefer 'shuai', which means handsome for boys. Those are some common and popular names in China.
