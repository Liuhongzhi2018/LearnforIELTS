Part 2

37.   Describe a family member who you want to work with in the future. 

You should say:
Who he/she is
Whether you worked together before
What kind of work you would like to do with him/ her
And explain how you feel about this family member

Let me tell you about my brother that I'd like to work with in my business. He is very considerate and thoughtful person who has always done his best to help me make decisions in the face of day-to-day difficulties.

My brother has a strong personality and he never lets others tell him what to do. I learned how to be more responsible and also more determined in my daily life. Although we've never worked together in business before, he always reminds me that things are not as easy as they appear and that I should work hard in order to get results.

I'd like to work with my brother because it's lucky enough to find a wonderful partner in him, both personally and professionally. We can be honest with one another, and I trust him significantly more than I’ve trusted partners in the past. My brother is very loyal and I believe he will always watch my back. Although, I will say it is very important to define roles and boundaries with family immediately. He does tend to push the limits of what is acceptable if rules are not clearly defined. It also just so happens that our skill sets are completely opposite and complementary.

37.1. What kind of family business are common in China?

There are different types of family businesses in China. The first type is the artisan family, which is characterized by exclusive secrets, nurtured from an early age, and perfected skills. For example, I visited a family business that specialized in noodle production, where the father founded the business and the children were apprenticed. The father started the business and the children were apprentices. The business was then handed over to the three brothers of the son's generation, and in the third generation the three cousins are still managing the business together. Such a business is not concerned with its own size; its main point is how to how to keep the technical superiority and quality of its products at the forefront or even the best of its peers.

There is another kind of financial family, such a family puts their main energy into the field of investment and finance, and carries out a lot of capital operation. The Rong family, for example, remains a model for Chinese financial families even today.

37.2. Is it good to work with family members? Why?

Well, there is definitely a positive side to working with a family member. For instance, relationships can be stronger as you've more time to spend with your loved one. The workplace atmosphere may be more easygoing. For example, in a typical corporate culture where flexibility isn’t built into your contract, it may not be an issue if you periodically arrive late or leave early.

37.3. Why do people want to do family business?

This is because a family-run company may have a more relaxed environment. They can be their own bosses. Instead of becoming an employee, they could provide employment to hundreds or even thousands. Apart from this, the desire to keep things profitable and stable for future generations is usually very strong in a family business.

37.4. What benefits are there when working for big companies?

There are countless advantages of working in a Multinational company. For example, one of the obvious benefits of working for a large company is that there are a lot of perks. Large companies can offer their employees "more," because they have more resources. Most importantly, working at a large company gives you many professional opportunities. You will have access to a larger network, which can pay dividends down the line.
