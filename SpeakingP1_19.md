# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

19.  Writing

19.1  Do you write a lot?

Not really, I am too busy to find a period of time when I can totally cool down and focus on writing. In my fragmented spare time, I prefer to do some other things to entertain myself. Only when I have too many feelings to express, will I sit down and write something.


19.2  What do you like to write? Why?

The only thing I would like to write is probably my own experience. I used to write diaries, which I believe was quite an effective way for me to reflect on myself. Nowadays, I still write something about what I’ve been through every now and then.


19.3  Do you think the things you write would change?

Sure. I mean, with the growing age, my views towards the same things may change greatly. Even just about the same travel experience, I may use different words to describe it than the ones I used at a younger age.


19.4 Do you prefer typing or handwriting when you are writing?

I would definitely opt for typing. Nowadays, I can’t live without my computer. Typing is so easy and smooth for me to record my feelings. After that I can also post them on my social media.
