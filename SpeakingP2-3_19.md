Part 2

19.   Describe a problem you had while shopping online or in a store. 

You should say:
When it happened
What you bought
What problem you had
And explain how you felt about the experience

The problem I'll describe is about being harassed by customer service staff from an online store. It was about two months ago. The cleanser I was using was running out and the store where I always buy skincare products was out of stock, so I decided to find another store.

I came upon a store with a huge fanbase on Taobao and a high rating for product quality, after-sale service and logistics. I also read the comments left by other customers, especially the ones that were not so good to gain a full picture of the possible reasons for complaints. There were only a few such negative comments and people who gave them all left pretty good follow-up comments after using the products for a few days, so they didn't cause any concern and I bought a Clarins foaming face wash from that store.

When I received the product a few days later, I compared it with the one I was still using, which I’m 100% sure is original, and I found the packaging was flimsy, the product was watery and the scent coming out of the container was totally different from the old one.

It’s counterfeit no doubt. So I posted my disbelief and disappointment online and also talked to the customer service staff, who suggested a full refund in exchange for the deletion of my comment. I was furious. I mean, what kind of solution was that! And so I refused to do what she proposed. What happened for the next two days was their team harassed me by phone calls and text messages for god knows how many times.

I wasn't gonna give in, because it's not my fault and now I know where those good follow-up comments come from.


Part 3


19.1. What kind of customer service do you think is good?

Well, I guess a good customer support agent needs to be a product expert. They should believe in their product. And they should be able to discuss the product features in an insightful way. And not to mention troubleshoot anything that is not working right. So the good customer service can help the customers get the most out of their purchase and feel like they got true value for their money.

19.2. What are the differences between shopping online or in store?

Well, the most apparent distinction is the price. If you buy something online, it’s usually way cheaper. And that’s so true when it comes to books. There could be at last a 40% discount online compared with the brick-and-mortar stores, Another difference is the attitude. Off line shopping can be pleasant due to the hearty smile and attentive service. But online customer interactions are not face to face. It’s easy to misinterpret the tone of written communication, which can come across as cold.

19.3. What problems do customers often have while shopping?

The biggest problem is to find the best product within their budget. They have to find the middle ground between the cost and the quality. Another problem is that the shop owner will exaggerate the features of the products and twist your arms to buy what you don’t need. Sometimes the customers will have to choose from the products which don’t live up to the hype.

19.4. What do you think customers should do when there are problems with products bought online?

They should find the customer support agents and inform them of the issue. It’s a way to identify whether the malfunction is innate or because the user didn’t follow the instructions. And then, if the problem lies in the product, customers can submit a complaint and get a refund.
