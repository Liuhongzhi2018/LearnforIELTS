11.  Morning time

11.1  Do you like getting up early in the morning?

Yes, I get up early in the morning in every working day, and I have to get up at 6 am and remember 50 English words. After having the breakfast, I go to the classroom to study before 8 am.

Yes, I am a morning person, since I feel extra power in my body in the morning, and I usually get up at about 7, or slightly earlier than that. But if it is a weekend, I might wake up a bit later so I can relax a bit.

Well, yes, I do. I used to stay up very late and sleep until midday, but I decided to lead a more healthy life last year. Now I wake up with the chirping of birds outside every morning and watch the colour of the sky changes as the sun rises. Getting up early allows me to get more things done before lunch and also makes me more energetic during the day.

Yes, I wake up early in the morning as I like to give myself enough time to get ready and have breakfast before I go to my college. If I don’t get up early, I have to rush in the morning and sometimes miss my bus.

Well, (no,) I’m (not) a morning person. Since I was a child, getting up early has been fairly (miserable) to me, which means (normally I would take 10 or 15 minutes to rise from my bed) after the alarm clock ringing. On top of that, this habit may contribute a lot to (my lateness for school and work). (However, I can do nothing about it.)

11.2 What do you usually do when you get up early?

After getting up, I have a shower first and then prepare the breakfast. Before leaving home, I would like to remember the English words or enjoy the news on the TV.


11.3 What do you usually do in the morning?

I usually study in the morning. After a night's sleep, I normally feel very energetic and my concentration level is also at its peak, which enables me to absorb knowledge and memorize things more easily.

After waking up, I usually get out of bed, of course, and i go into the kitchen and prepare my breakfast. If it is still early, I might cook an omelette, which is my favorite, but it is a bit time-consuming And then I’ll catch up with the recent news while having my breakfast. I do all this before I jump in the shower, clean myself and get ready for the day.

The first thing I usually do when I wake up is meditate for a few minutes. I would sit on my yoga mat with my legs crossed and try to focus on my breath. Practicing meditation gets me prepared for the new day both physically and mentally. After that, I’d make myself a nice breakfast, as a good day starts with a good meal. Another thing I do before setting out to work is I’d note down the important things I’m going to do for the day on my memo.

I like to start my morning with a cup of tea. I also play with my dog a bit and then get ready for college.

The first thing after getting up is (definitely serving myself a cup of coffee). Then (attending lectures would be) the regular routine for school days. Besides, on weekends and vacations, I would (stay in bed and chat with my friends online until lunch time).

11.4 What did you do in the morning when you were little? Why? 

Well, when I was a small kid, I needed to get up really early to go to school. So in the morning, it was like a battle. I hurried to get up, to clean myself, and to have breakfast, very chaotic. But at that time, we also went to bed early, so fair enough.

I remember I liked drawing when i was a little girl and I would spend a lot of time drawing on my sketchpad when I get up. Sometimes my mom would send me to my grandparents’ place on her way to work. My granddad is good at Chinese calligraphy and we would spend long hours practicing it together.

There is no surprise here but (going to school). From Monday to Friday, I got up at (6:30 in order to attend the morning class in time). In addition, there were some (extra curriculum courses on every weekend morning), which (I have to admit that it was not my own intention).


11.5 Are there any differences between what you do in the morning now and what you did in the past?

The major difference lies in preparing breakfast. I used to live with my parents, and they would make breakfast for me, while now I live by myself, so I have to make meals for myself.

Oh yes. When I was in high school, I had to get up very early in the morning, because our first class started at 7:10. After getting into uni, I have more time at my disposal, so I can do whatever I wanna do after I get up. Sometimes, I’d go to the sports field for jogging because it’s always so empty at that time and I could have the whole place to myself. And sometimes, I would read some interesting books in my dorm room or go to the library for study.

Yes, of course. The most significant variation of morning routine is (the first hour after getting up). When I was a child, I would (directly go to school and have classes). Mind you, nowadays, (browsing some news online on a cup of coffee) is the regular activity I have in the morning in order to (wake myself up and catch up with this eternally changing world).

11.6 Do you spend your mornings doing the same things on both weekends and weekdays? Why?

Sort of, some routines are the same but on weekends I do sleep an extra hour and try to avoid deep-working sessions because I think that only when I have a good weekend rest, can I be more productive next week.
