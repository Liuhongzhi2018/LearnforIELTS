Part 2

28.    Describe an occasion that you lost something. 

You should say:
What you lost
When and where you lost it
What you did to find it
And explain how you felt about it

Ok, what I'm gonna talk about is the time I left my smartphone in a taxi, which is a really silly thing to do, I know, but sometimes I can be quite careless, just like everyone can be on occasion. The phone is a gift my mother gave me on my 16th birthday, and though it looks quite old, it does carry much sentimental value to me.

Anyway, as for when I lost my mobile, well thinking about it, I suppose it must've been a couple of years ago by now, as I seem to remember I was still living in my old apartment at the time. And regarding what I was doing when it happened, well basically, I was in a taxi on my way back home from the city centre, as I’d just been out clothes shopping, so I had quite a few bags with me, and I guess this partly explains how I somehow managed to leave my phone behind in the taxi.

So as for how felt after I realized what I’d done, well, if I remember correctly, my first reaction was that of disbelief, you know, I was thinking to myself, how could I have been so stupid as to leave it there. And what made it all the more frustrating was the fact that I hadn’t asked the driver for a receipt, which I normally always do, so there was no way I could get in touch with the taxi company and track down the taxi which I took.

Naturally of course, I tried to call my phone as soon as I realized what had happened, but as guessed, it had already been switched off, either by the driver or the next person who got into the taxi.

Right after the incident, I gave the taxi company a ring to see if some driver happened to see it. However, all my efforts went in vain when no one seemed to have said they found the item. I felt down in the dumps for the rest of the day, just thinking about the gift of my mother that had vanished forever.

Part 3

28.1. What kind of things do people usually lose?

Well, I think that phones, keys, and glasses top the list of the most commonly lost items. Running second to them are battery chargers, stationery, wallets and documents, especially passports and driver’s licenses. Oh, and umbrellas as well. If we also talk about what people lose at home, I am more than sure that the leader is a TV remote control, as I also lose it every now and then.

I think people often lose the things which they use on a daily basis. Since these things are used so frequently they are often moved around and left in different places or in different pockets. Therefore, it is easy to forget where we have left them. So people often lose their phones, their wallets or their keys. As these are things we need to use on a daily basis it is often very frustrating to lose these things.

28.2. What do people often do when losing things?

Try to return it, of course. If that's not possible, then you can usually hand it to someone who can help, like the police or, or you could put up a notice to show that you found it.

28.3. Is it an effective way to use rewards to find lost things?

When it comes to locating their losing things, people are willing to go great lengths to ensure the safe return of their things. A cash reward may grab the attention of individuals who wouldn't typically enlist in the search. With more people willing to locate and return the things, there is a greater chance of being reunited.

28.4. What kind of people may lose things often?

I guess people who are usually absent minded and forgetful have high tendency of loosing things. Just like my close friend who is usually an absent minded person; the time when he just went around the city to unwind, he was not able to deter the thief who stole his smart phone. And the second time he decided to travel alone he, had some trouble remembering where he had placed the important personal belongings he brought with him during the travel. He indeed had lost many important things for tolerating this kind of attitude within himself. In general I can say that people who do not exercise their mind to be alert have high risk of losing things very often.
