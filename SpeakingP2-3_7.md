Part 2

7.  Describe a photo you took that you are proud of. 

You should say:
When you took it
Where you took it
What is in this photo
And explain why you are proud of it

A photo of me that I enjoy is the one taken in the Great Wall, which is located in Beijing. I couldn't remember the exact date when it was taken. But I'm pretty sure it was during the summer holiday before I went to the first grade of primary school. My father was about to have a business trip to Beijing, and his company allowed him to bring family members. So he took my mother and me there.

My father took his picture near a famous stone tablet which was inscribed with a sentence written by Mao Tsedong, who is one of the first leaders of this nation. The inscription can be translated in English as One who fails to reach the Great Wall is not a hero.

Well, I felt extremely excited to have a picture like this. One of the reason is that it has a perfect composition. You know the nice posture, the unique tablet, and the stunning background view of the Great Wall are something worth showing off to my friends. It also made me feel grateful when I looked at the picture. You know, being able to go to Beijing and appreciate one of the great wonders of the world at that time was a luxurious thing for my peers.



Part 3

7.1 Why do some people like to record important things with photos?

These pictures function as an aid to memory. Photos are a great memory-prompt, and because we tend to take photos of happy occasions, they weight our memories to the good. Photos remind us of the people, places, and activities we love. Many people keep photos in their homes, in their office, or in their wallet, and happy families tend to display large numbers of photos at home.

7.2 What can people learn from historical photographs?

For many people, collecting antique and historical photographs is a hobby but historians examine these kind of photos regularly. They examine them to see what life was like in the period they were shot. Historical photos can yield a lot of information.

7.3 Is taking photos the best way to remember something?

Taking photos is not the perfect memory-retention tool. Snapping too many pictures could actually harm the brain's ability to retain memories. As with information, when we take pictures we're offloading the responsibility of remembering onto an external device. we're so distracted by the process of taking a photo that we miss the moment altogether.
