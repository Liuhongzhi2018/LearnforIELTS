口语 Part 1

10. Housework and cooking

10.1  Do you do some cooking / help your family cook at home now?

Yeah, I often do cooking at home because cooking at home can even take less time that eating out. There are plenty of quick, simple, and wholesome meals I can cook at home in less time than it takes to travel to a restaurant or wait for a delivery.

Yes, I do. Since the outbreak of covid, I have started to help my family cook at home. You know, it's relatively safer and cheaper to eat at home, and I have more free time because I don't need to go to school quite often than in the past, which ceates many opportunities for me to cook.

10.2 Do you think your home is clean and tidy?

Yes, I do. Because I pay attention to my tidiness as much as I can. For instance, I make my bed and clean up my room on a daily basis, and make sure that everything in my room is in order. So I think my home is clean and tidy.

10.3 Did you do some house cleaning when you were young?

Yes, I did. When I was little, my mom would teach me to make my bed and fold my quilt. I was told to wipe my desk regularly every week. This helped me develop the habit of keeping things neat and tidy from a young age.

10.4 Do you have breakfast at home everyday?

Yes, I do prefer breakfast at home. I believe breakfast should be at home. After that you can plan other things from outside restro. I think the perfect breakfast with family members is a great idea and everyone likes it. I prepare many different items. Generally we had breakfast together and then chat and go for work.

10.5 Do you want to learn how to cook well?

Yes, I do. Learning to cook will help me understand world cultures, customs and flavors. I will also learn life skills like eating healthy, budgeting money, and cleaning. Save some cash. Cooking is less expensive than eating at restaurants, fast food joints and school cafeterias.

10.6 What housework do you like or dislike doing?

I have to say I hate cleaning the toilet because the toilet is really germy. And I hate the smell of toilet detergent, it's very pungent.
