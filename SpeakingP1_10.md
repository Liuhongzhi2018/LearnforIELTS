10. Housework and cooking

10.1  Do you do some cooking / help your family cook at home now?

Yeah, I often do cooking at home because cooking at home can even take less time that eating out. There are plenty of quick, simple, and wholesome meals I can cook at home in less time than it takes to travel to a restaurant or wait for a delivery.

10.2 Do you think your home is clean and tidy?



10.3 Did you do some house cleaning when you were young?



10.4 Do you have breakfast at home everyday?

Yes, I do prefer breakfast at home. I believe breakfast should be at home. After that you can plan other things from outside restro. I think the perfect breakfast with family members is a great idea and everyone likes it. I prepare many different items. Generally we had breakfast together and then  chat and then go for work. 



10.5 Do you want to learn how to cook well?
