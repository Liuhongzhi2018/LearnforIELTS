# Lesson 17

口语 Part 1

13.   Puzzles 

13.1  Did you do puzzles in your childhood?

Actually, I started to love them when I grew up, cuz when I was little, I didn't have much patience to deal with those annoying pieces. I still remember my father bought me a puzzle of a famous painting called starry sky by Vincent van Gogh. And you know the whole picture is full of similar stars and light, OMG, which was my nightmare during that period.

13.2 When do you do puzzles, during your trip or when you feel bored?

If you are talking about that big jigsaw, then definitely no! I don't even have enough space for my clothes and skin care products. Who's going to take a puzzle? What's more, what if you finish it half of the way, how are you going to keep them?

13.3 Do you like doing word puzzles or number puzzles? Which is more difficult for you?

I would say word puzzle can be my preference, only if I must choose one. Cuz I really have no patience and interest in numbers. Whatever related to numbers drives me crazy.

13.4 Do you think it is good for old people to do puzzles?

Sure! You know, doing such a thing does need full concentration and strong sensitivity, which can help to distinguish and complete it efficiently. And all of this may help to improve old people’s reaction speed and adjust their moods.
