# Lesson 17

口语 Part 1

13.   Puzzles 

13.1  Did you do puzzles in your childhood?

Actually, I started to love them when I grew up, cuz when I was little, I didn't have much patience to deal with those annoying pieces. I still remember my father bought me a puzzle of a famous painting called starry sky by Vincent van Gogh. And you know the whole picture is full of similar stars and light, OMG, which was my nightmare during that period.

Yes, when I was a kid there were lots of puzzles we could do – with string, and wood, and jigsaws and all sorts of little stuff like that. Now, there isn’t so much – there’s a lot of puzzle games, and games involving cryptic thinking on apps on phones and tablets, though. Those are popular today.

13.2 When do you do puzzles, during your trip or when you feel bored?

If you are talking about that big jigsaw, then definitely no! I don't even have enough space for my clothes and skin care products. Who's going to take a puzzle? What's more, what if you finish it half of the way, how are you going to keep them?

I usually play such puzzle games on my phone when I’m on the train or on a bus, or something like that. I also fiddle with my phone in bed too, like a lot of people, and yes, sometimes I play games which you could call 'puzzles' I guess.

13.3 Do you like doing word puzzles or number puzzles? Which is more difficult for you?

I would say word puzzle can be my preference, only if I must choose one. I really have no patience and interest in numbers. Whatever related to numbers drives me crazy.

I prefer number puzzles. I am really good at math, and I like solving little math problems. There are plenty of games which involving solving number puzzles and I enjoy doing these. I get a great sense of satisfaction from getting the answers right.

13.4 Do you think it is good for old people to do puzzles?

Sure. You know, doing such a thing does need full concentration and strong sensitivity, which can help to distinguish and complete it efficiently. And all of this may help to improve old people’s reaction speed and adjust their moods.

Yes, most certainly. I think old people should do these things to keep their minds active – a lot of research shows that older people remain mentally sharp for longer if they keep engaging their brains in puzzles and activities that involving thinking and solving things.
