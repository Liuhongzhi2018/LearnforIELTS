Part 2

18.   Describe a popular place for sports that you've been to. 

You should say:
Where it is
When you went there
What you did there
And explain how you felt about this place

I like to talk about a swimming pool near my home. It is actually a community sports center with a swimming pool on the ground floor and a gym on the first floor. It is very popular because every time I go there it is filled with residents from all ages. So, last year I finally decided to learn how to swim, and I found out that there were swimming classes in that center so I signed up for it immediately.

The classes were taken place in the shallow area of the pool and there were eight students including me. All adults. The class for children were set on a different date so it wouldn’t be that crowded and messy in the pool.

I think that was very nice and the coach was really friendly and professional. He first helped us to choose some suitable equipments for beginners. You know like nose clips or ear plugs and a floating board. And then he told us how to take a breath while swimming. We learned breastroke because that was considered to be the easiest style of swimming. Actually that was not easy for me, I couldn’t keep the right movement and I always choked on water. But the coach you know he was really patient, He helped me to practice step by step and He really built up my confidence by comforting and encouraging me a lot.

So after several classes gradually I got used to the feeling and I was able to swim by myself. Now I will go to that swimming pool to practice my swimming skills from time to time. I really like that place because that’s where I learned swimming.
