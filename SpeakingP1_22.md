# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

22.   Evening time 

22.1  Do you like the morning or evening? 

Personally, I prefer the morning than the evening. The mornings are the times when I really can focus on my studies the best and my concentration is at its peak. That's mainly because I am someone who sleeps early and wakes up early feeling very refreshed.

22.2  What do you usually do in the evening? 

In the evenings I like to relax, basically. Just rest and listen to music on headphones, or watch a TV show or something like that. I have friends who always study in the evenings. Not me. I like to rest in the evenings. I don’t even go out much.

22.3  What did you do in the evening when you were little? Why?

If I remember rightly, I have fond memories that I used to have a ball with my toys, especially with my doll/electric car. I have a distant memory of playing hide and seek in the street.

22.4  Are there any differences between what you do in the evening now and what you did in the past?

Yes, most certainly. When I was a bit younger I would have a much more active social life in the evenings, and I also used to try to study in bed at night too. Now, I have a much more organized life. I always get up early, get things done in the morning and in the day, and rest at night.

22.5 Do you spend your evenings doing the same things on both weekends and weekdays? Why?

No, we don't. We usually continue to study on weekday evenings and have little entertainment. But on weekend evenings, we play games and watch TV shows, occasionally do laundry, and mainly aim to rest.
