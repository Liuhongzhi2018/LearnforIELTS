Part 2

6.  Describe an object that you think is beautiful. 

You should say:
What it is
Where you saw it
What it looks like
And explain why you think it is beautiful

Well, I like to talk about hanfu. it's a traditional clothing of Chinese people in ancient China. I’ve got one piece of han-style dress from my friend two years ago. Actually we were both into traditional Chinese culture. So she bought me this dress as a gift on my birthday

It's a very beautiful dress. It's a white dress and it has got this long and huge sleeves. I guess people in the past would put their money and other personal stuff in these sleeves. It's made of silk so it's very soft and light. It's also made up of many layers so you know when the wind blows these layers would just be blown up and floating in the air. So it's kind of like a fairy it’s very beautiful.

Also, there are many flower patterns on the dress and, these are all exquisite work so the whole dress is very delicate and beautiful. I always go out in this dress with my friends we will go to some Natural Parks or some ancient buildings to take some photos. These dresses can just match with the scenery perfectly.

Well, although the dress is not that convenient to wear because it's very long and multi-layered. Personally, I would just ignore those things because they’re so beautiful and it’s a very good way to promote Chinese traditional culture. And you know that more people get to know its beauty.

Part 3

6.1 Do you think there are more beautiful things now than in the past? Why?

 No, I do not think that things are more beautiful now than in the past because in ancient times, everything was handmade and handicraft, and it had its own value, while in the present time, things are made by machinery, and they are not long-lasting.

Nowadays, things are more fashionable and facilitating, but longevity is relatively low as compared to the past.in short, things have become more precious, beautiful, and artistic in the past years.

6.2 What beautiful scenery spots are there in your country?

China's vast and diverse territory endows the country with some of the most beautiful natural scenery on earth. From the picturesque karst landscape in Guilin and Yangshuo to the precipitous pillars in Zhangjiajie, from the Rainbow Mountains in Zhangye to the holy high land of Tibet, China's diverse natural beauty is as impressive as it is splendid culture.

6.3 Where do you think people usually come into contact with beautiful things?

People like to keep beautiful objects in their homes and offices as showpieces. They generally get them from the décor shops in the malls. 

6.4 Why do you think people create beautiful things?

People create beautiful things to express their creativity. Some people also say that art is a form which connects us with our spiritual being. With the help of art people can also connect with each other.
