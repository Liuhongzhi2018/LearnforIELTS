I wanna talk about Wanning, a costal city on China's Hainan Island, which has emerged as one of the most popular tourist cities among young people. It's a perfect destination for those who want a wonderful beach holiday.

The city is well-known for surfing, so the most popular activity you can do there is no doubt surfing. There're surf clubs providing surfing equipments and training for beginners, so don't worry if you have no experience. Apart from surfing, you can do a wide range of water sports, including diving, rowing, sailing, jet skiing and many more.

For sightseeing, there's a mountain park called Dongshan ridge, one of the few sacred mountains on Hainan Island. Then there's a tropical botanical garden which has thousands of species of tropical and subtropical plants. Another famous tourist attraction is Xinglong Coffce Valley, a coffee plantation that has been turned into a tourist attraction, which includes a small museum about the history of local coffee industry, and there are also many cafes where you can sample the coffee and other products grown here.

As for food, of course there're various fresh seafood you can try, clams, oysters, mussels, shrimps, crabs, lobsters, you name it. There are open markets where customers can pick their own favorites and have them cooked to personal preference. Besides, the city is famous for Southeast Asian foods because the city has been substantially influenced by a wave of overseas Chinese who immigrated there from Southeast Asia during the mid-20th century. If you love dessert, don't miss out on the stir-fried ice cream, which is a kind of gelato made of milk, cream and sugars as well as other added ingredients and decorated with various toppings.

The reason why I recommend it is that it's a place you can chill out and meet interesting people. I went there last year and had a whale of time. I’m sure so will you if have a trip there.

Part 3

13.1 Is it important to take photos while traveling?

Yes, of course. It's always a great idea to take a few snaps of nature, the landscape, the sightseeing, the wonderful landmarks, and monuments, or even some interesting and colorful people. The best photographs are the pictures I take while traveling, especially abroad. There are so many wonders to discover, that I can't wait to get started again.

13.2 Can you trust other people's travel journals on the Internet?

I think the travel logs shared by others on the Internet can be used as a reference, but you can't trust them completely, you also need to make trade-offs according to the actual situation.

13.3 What factors affect how people feel about traveling?

Your mindset determines everything, your mindset determines your initial intention for travel, and thus choose your favorite way of travel, to reach your favorite destination, noisy or quiet, follow your heart. Let you do not pretend not vain, not floating on the surface, so that the meaning of travel really into the heart.

13.4 Will you go to a foreign country to travel because of the distinct landscape?

Yes, I will. Because some foreign attractions and buildings are not available in China, such as Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre in France, which have both long historical features and modern technology.
