I wanna talk about Wanning, a costal city on China's Hainan Island, which has emerged as one of the most popular tourist cities among young people. It's a perfect destination for those who want a wonderful beach holiday.

The city is well-known for surfing, so the most popular activity you can do there is no doubt surfing. There're surf clubs providing surfing equipments and training for beginners, so don't worry if you have no experience. Apart from surfing, you can do a wide range of water sports, including diving, rowing, sailing, jet skiing and many more.

For sightseeing, there's a mountain park called Dongshan ridge, one of the few sacred mountains on Hainan Island. Then there's a tropical botanical garden which has thousands of species of tropical and subtropical plants. Another famous tourist attraction is Xinglong Coffce Valley, a coffee plantation that has been turned into a tourist attraction, which includes a small museum about the history of local coffee industry, and there are also many cafes where you can sample the coffee and other products grown here.

As for food, of course there're various fresh seafood you can try, clams, oysters, mussels, shrimps, crabs, lobsters, you name it. There are open markets where customers can pick their own favorites and have them cooked to personal preference. Besides, the city is famous for Southeast Asian foods because the city has been substantially influenced by a wave of overseas Chinese who immigrated there from Southeast Asia during the mid-20th century. If you love dessert, don't miss out on the stir-fried ice cream, which is a kind of gelato made of milk, cream and sugars as well as other added ingredients and decorated with various toppings.

The reason why I recommend it is that it's a place you can chill out and meet interesting people. I went there last year and had a whale of time. I’m sure so will you if have a trip there.
