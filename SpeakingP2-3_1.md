口语 Part 2 & Part 3

Part 2

1.  Describe the home of someone you know well and that you often visit 

You should say:
Whose home it is
How often you go there
What it is like
And explain how you feel about the home

The home I am going to tell you about is my classmate's. To be more specific, it is not the place where he lives with his parents, but a flat he rents as a temporary home when he is studying at the university. It is located right next to our campus. With ten minutes'walk, he can reach the teaching building. It is equipped with a 24-hour power supply, hot water, and internet access, which is much more convenient and comfortable than the dormitory.


Part 3

1.1 What are the differences between buildings in the city and in the countryside?

First of all, the buildings in the city are more densely arranged, while the building density in the countryside is less. Secondly, urban buildings are taller and have more floors, while rural buildings are relatively short and have fewer floors. In addition to expanding to high altitudes, urban buildings also expand to underground spaces such as subways and underground commercial streets, while rural buildings are built on the ground.

1.2 Do you prefer to live in the city or in the countryside?

I prefer the city because it is conveninent and full of opportunities. Some people like the peace and slow pace of life in the countryside, but I find it a little boring.


1.3 What safety risks are there in residential buildings in cities?

There are potential electrical safety hazards in urban residential quarters, and residents’ random wiring of wires can easily lead to fires. There are also hidden dangers to personal and property safety, and old anti-theft facilities are easy for thieves to succeed.

1.4 Is it expensive to decorate a house or an apartment in the place where you live?

It's more expensive to decorate a house or apartment where I live. The mid-range decoration price is generally around 1200-1500 yuan per square meter. Even the ordinary decoration price is around 700-1200 yuan per square meter.
