口语 Part 1

34.     Sports programs

34.1 Do you like watching sports programs on TV?

Yes, but just sometimes, I am not a big fan of sports, but I do like ping-pong, it’s exciting to watch on TV, they move so quickly.

34.2 Do you like to watch live sports games?

No, I am not a sports lover at all, I would rather spend time on watching documentary films instead of sports games.

34.3 Who do you like to watch sports games with?

I don't know, I am not sure. There is no specific person that comes into my mind. But if I have to, I think I will invite my parents, they love sports.

34.4 What kinds of games do you expect to watch in the future?

Maybe Latin dance? I guess, It's not quite easy to see Latin games on TV sometimes I can just search the videos on cellphones. But with a bigger screen on TV, I bet it will be much better.
