32.     Daily routine

32.1 What is your daily study routine?

My daily activities depend on my work schedule, so nothing is fixed. The only routine I never skip is writing in a diary, which gives me time to reflect on my day.

I’m an early riser so I wake up at around 6 o’clock, then I have a cup of coffee 30 minutes after that before I go to the gym. I stay at home for pretty much the whole afternoon and I teach English classes in the evening.

32.2 Have you ever changed your routine?

Yes, lately I am trying to change my sleeping habit. In the past, I pulled a lot of all-nighters, and would often doze off in class during the day. These days, I force myself to go to bed early, and you know what, I have never felt so refreshed in the morning.

32.3 Do you think it is important to have a daily routine for your study?

Definitely yes. Having a fixed daily routine for study is a crucial part of academic life and even for our future life. As a matter of fact, learning how to manage time is a very important skill for everyone of us, especially for some students.

32.4 What part of your day do you like best?

My favourite time of the day would be 7 p.m., which is when I come back from work and gather around the dinner table with my family. Seeing them after a long hard-working day can help me feel recharged, so I look forward to this time of the day the most.

Probably the morning. I do exercise regularly in my room when the sun rises, and sometimes I go to the gym. What’s best about the morning is coffee time. I just love it because coffee keeps me active all day long.

32.5. What is the busiest part of the day for you?

I am a procrastinator, so I tend to get extremely busy at night, when all my work piles up. I love working at those hours though, because no motivation is as good as the urge to sleep.

32.6. Do you usually have the same routine every day?

I used to, back when I was still a student. Now that I have started working, I don’t have a fixed schedule anymore. Since my working time is uite flexible, there are days I can just sleep in, but there are also days I have to wake up really early in the morning.
Pretty much yeah, although there’s a slight change on Sunday. I usually wake up really late on Sunday and I don’t have any coffee either. I just want to spend my weekend in my warm bed.

32.7. Do you think it is important to have a daily routine?

I honestly think it is essential to have a daily routine. Human bodies have a biological clock that works according to routine. By sticking to that fixed schedule, we can prevent our body from getting shock.
It’s not something that a person can’t live without I think. It’s important to me but it doesn’t mean that everyone should follow a routine everyday. It’s fun to have changes once in a while.

32.8. What would you like to change in your daily routine?

If time permits, I would love to make exercise a part of my daily routine. It’s not like I am not aware of the wonders exercise can do to my health, I just can’t seem to fit a workout into my tight schedule.

Well if I can, I want to cancel or 2 classes in the evening because I really could use some nights to go around the city. Working 7 days a week is not a great idea.
