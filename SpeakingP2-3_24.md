Part 2

24.   Describe a quiet place you like to go. 

You should say:
Where it is?
How you knew it?
How often you go there?
What you do there?
And explain how you feel about the place

I'd like to talk about one of my favourite quiet places where I go sometimes. This quiet place, where I like to go sometimes, is a small valley located a bit far away from my home, next to a garden of many different kinds of native plants. Not sure when or how the valley was formed there as no water streams could be found anywhere near it, but I have always thought that there might be some interesting history behind this small valley.

But, anyway, this is a valley that feels like it is located thousands of miles away from civilization, when I visit it with an upset or restless mind, because of its truly quiet surroundings. Of course, one could easily listen to the chirping sounds of the birds from its adjacent native garden, but that sound is nowhere close to as disturbing as the sound of a busy city; rather quite the opposite. In fact, if anything, that chirping sound of the birds feels very much reassuring to me as it reminds me about some many wonderful things in an otherwise tough world.

I like to visit this place only during the late morning because this is when I get to enjoy some refreshingly gentle southern wind, offering some calming effects on my otherwise restless mind. By the way, I like to visit this place, not only because it is nice and quiet, but also because I can see the whole sky in its true colours from here.

Anyway, whenever I go to this place, I spend my time there by mostly walking across the valley just like I did the last time. However, when I went there last time, I spent some time there also reading a book while laying myself down on its ground.


Part 3


24.1. Is it easy to find quiet places in your country? Why?

No, it's very hard to find quiet places in cities nowadays because of increasing urbanization
and cars on the street. I think that's one of the major reasons people go on vacations. Unfortunately, tourist spots are even more crowded.

24.2. Why do old people prefer to live in quiet places?

Actually of course. Most of the aged people prefer to live in quiet places, such as the suburbs or countryside. They choose to live in such kinds of area mainly because they are likely to have a peaceful lifestyle in general. You know like the fresh air and quiet environment are actually good for their health. You know the senior citizens in these day are big fans to gardening or tea, they need somewhere close to the interest. It is more reasonable to live in the suburbs. It big house and small garden or yard can be required. 

24.3. Why are there more noises made at home now than in the past?

There are many sources of noise in the home, such as from the sound of computers running, the sound of kitchen exhaust fans and the sound of water flowing down the drain. There are now more electronics in the home than in the past, which can generate more noise.

24.4. Why do some people like to use noise as background sound when they are working and studying?

If we were all to work and study in complete silence, we would constantly be searching for reasons to be distracted. This is natural. As human beings, we're always on the lookout for mental and physical stimulation. Unfortunately, there are a lot of mundane jobs and tasks out there that offer very little in the way of stimulation. If a job doesn't challenge us, we will always look for something that does. Adding background noise to your work or study routine can benefit your concentration by adding an extra layer of mental stimulation. It can encourage you, inspire you or simply ease the boredom you're feeling. ​​It can encourage you, inspire you or simply ease the boredom you're feeling.
