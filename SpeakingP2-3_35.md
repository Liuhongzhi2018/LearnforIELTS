Part 2

35.   Describe a friend you like to talk with. 

You should say:
Who he/she is
What you like to talk about
Why you like to talk with him/her
And explain how you feel about him/her

There's nothing I enjoy more than a good conversation, and being able to comfortably chat for hours is a make or break prerequisite for any of my close friendships. As I roll through life I've gained the habit of acquiring new acquaintances, which drift naturally in and out of my social orbit.

However, there's one individual who I’ve been very close with for nearly a decade now, he's undoubtedly my best mate by a country mile and it's who I'll talk about today. Liam is his name and he’s roughly 5 years my junior. The origin story of our relationship is a touch convoluted so I’ll skip past it for the sake of time. In a nutshell, we were once neighbors. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic we've been unable to meet face to face, which one might think would harm the bond between us.

Yet, due to the magic of instant messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, we've hardly dropped a stitch and the vibrant tapestry of our friendship continues to be woven. Conversation has always been the bedrock of our relationship, so moving to a strictly digital one hasn't posed any problems at all for Liam and I. It would be easier to mention what we don’t chat about, as practically any topic or flight of fancy is on the table. Liam’s a real wordsmith and constantly cracks me up with his witty observations on life’s little trials and tribulations.

Running jokes and invented language pepper our calls and WhatsApp chatting history. Mirth aside, we can seamlessly switch to a more serious and reflective tone when the moment calls for it. We share the details of our high moments and the low alike, warts and all. This imbues our chats with a kind of therapeutic quality at times and it’s something we both greatly value. He’s an empathetic and non-judgmental soul, which makes me feel comfortable opening up about the difficult stuff.

In addition to that, his intellectual curiosity and unorthodox views make nattering away about a plethora of topics both enlightening and pleasurable. Not to sound too overdramatic, but I don’t know how I'd be able to deal with life if I didn't have him there. I’d probably end up going spare or at the very least drifting into a deep melancholy.

Part 3

35.1. Where do young people like to meet?

Recently, I’ve felt that I'm slowly drifting away from being officially ‘young’, nevertheless, I’ve got a fairly good idea about this and I doubt things have changed much in the past couple of years.

Meeting places will of course vary depending on individual preferences, like one’s hobbies, tastes and spending power, but I’ll generalize and try to pick some examples that are popular across the board. Clubs and bars are seemingly inseparable from social life of the youth.

It was the case in my heyday and still continues on. Whether it’s linking up with old friends for a night out, finding and hooking up with a romantic partner or simply chatting with some strangers, these venues serve as a social hub and meeting place for the younger crowd. The alcohol sold there eases inhibitions, loosens tongue and breaks down barriers between individuals, making for a fun, vibrant atmosphere.

While pubs are perfect for the night owls, where are youngsters meeting during daylight hours? I’d say that the trendy spot nowadays seems to be the cafe or coffee shop. The chic interiors and comfy chairs, combined with the tongue wagging stimulation of caffeinated beverages appear to be a recipe for a well-liked hangout location.

35.2. What do young people talk about when they meet up?

More or less the same topics as older adults. Their opinions might differ but the core human areas of interest don’t change that much in my view, and this is reflected in conversation. A few notable examples are: relationships, art and work or study. There are certainly more topics and subtopics but I’ll elaborate on these 3 main for the time being.

In my teenage years hardly a day went by when I didn’t chat with my mates about possible romantic relationships, fueled as we were by the heady cocktail of hormones that puberty provides. To the best of my knowledge girls were doing the same thing, even if the frequency and character of those conversations didn’t share a resemblance.

Music, films and other forms of artistic consumable media also form a solid bedrock of subject matter for chitchat. Whether it’s pop stars, rappers, big film franchises or social media influences, young people normally have an interest and opinion on them and they can easily spark discussion. Popular culture is so-called because it’s just that, popular.

The majority of youngsters are either in education or some form of paid employment, so it’s only natural that they’ll want to chinwag about it with their mates. Moaning about study schedules or strict bosses can help to ease their stresses a bit. On top of that, it’s true what they say, “a problem shared is a problem halved’. Peer advice and an empathetic ear are invaluable to young people, as well as folk of all ages.

35.3. Do you think people should be honest when talking with friends?

From my perspective, there’s a bit of a balancing act to be done here. Naturally, many would tend to state that friends should always be honest with each other 100 percent of the time. While that’s nice in theory and stems from positive ideas of being an upstanding loyal friend, in practice it’s a bit naive in my view.

Complete truthfulness in all situations will definitely lead to unnecessary hurt feelings. Recently, I was round at a good mate’s house for some home-cooked Mexican food. He’d slaved away at the stove for ages, marinating and preparing various sauces and side dishes. In reality, the beef for the fajitas was a bit too tough and chewy to be truly enjoyable.

However, I was hardly going to come out and say that to him. I think he was aware of it too but what purpose would be served by me telling him that to his face? It would seem ungrateful and like I hadn't appreciated the effort he’d put in. A bit of emotional intelligence should be applied to each unique situation as it occurs and ‘honesty’ isn’t always a universally good thing. While most of the time I’d encourage telling the truth to friends, a white lie now and again is prudent in companionship.

35.4. On what occasions do people talk with strangers?

For the socially anxious and outgoing alike, talking with previously unknown people is a fact of life and something we all must do from time to time. Take shopping for daily necessities for instance. In a large supermarket or convenience store, the cashier behind the counter might be a person you’re unfamiliar with. Yet, you’ll need to engage in a bit of conversation to complete the transaction, and on top of that, perhaps you’ll both have a bit of polite smalltalk at the same time.

This extends to restaurants, hairdressers, auto mechanics and most other service type jobs. I suppose the moral of the story is, if you require a service, chances are that you’ll need to talk to a stranger to get it done. Social situations are another place where it can be necessary. At parties, bars and clubs, the normal barriers between strangers are somewhat removed.

In these settings, it doesn’t seem too unusual to approach a person you don’t know and strike up some chat. It’s probably part of the reason why they’re so popular as it kind of contravenes normal social etiquette, which I think underneath the surface a lot of folk want to do. From time to time, I’ll see people conversing with strangers just on the street or public transport but it seems to be a bit of a rarity these days. It’s probably due to those unwritten rules that I previously referred to. Deep down, I believe that the majority of people are friendly and willing to engage with others.

I suppose maybe this is just me projecting my own feelings and desires on to others though, combined with my innate optimism. I can’t really blame individuals who just want to go about their business in their little private bubbles, god knows there are days when I’m like that too. Nonetheless, if more of us reached out to strangers more often, I think society would be better for it.
