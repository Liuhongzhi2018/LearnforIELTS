# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

33.     Science

33.1 Do you like science?

Yeah I really love it. For me, it's a fascinating subject. It helps us explain how things work based on facts and allows us to gain a deeper understanding of almost everything around us. It has laid the foundation for some of the greatest inventions in the world. Without it, our life wouldn't be as modern as it is now.

33.2 When did you start to learn about science?

As far back as I can remember, I first came into contact with science when I was still a primary school student. That was more than 15 years ago. It started off with simple math calculations, and as I got into secondary school, I began to learn about other science subjects like physics and chemistry.

33.3 Which science subject is interesting to you?

I'm greatly interested in physics as I think it's one of the most practical subjects at school. It enables me to have a clear picture of how something works. Another subject that I also enjoy studying is probably math. I love the feeling when I can finally find the answer for a difficult math problem after a long time dealing with it.

33.4 What kinds of interesting things you have done with science?

I have fortunately. Back in high school, my chemistry teachers sometimes took us to our school lab and demonstrated some chemical reactions. Then, we would pay close attention to what they were doing and try to redo those experiments. It was pretty fun and exciting.

33.5 Do you like watching science TV programs?

Yes, I do. I often watch science TV programs on TV such as CCTV-10 channel about science education, in which the Discovery program will reveal many archaeological discoveries, ancient exquisite skills and scientific phenomena, etc. Every time I watch it, I benefit a lot from it and gain knowledge.

33.6 Do Chinese people often visit science museums?

As far as I know, people don't go to the science museums very often. On the one hand, the facilities of science museums are outdated and lack of attraction. On the other hand, science museums are mainly for children, and in most cases, parents accompany their children to visit.
