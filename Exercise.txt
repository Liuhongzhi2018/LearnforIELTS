The pie charts present findings about what affected British students when they chose a college.
The availability of suitable courses abd degrees was the most important consideration in both years, although the proportion of students who chose this factor dropped from 40% to 34%. They were also concerned with the reputation of the university, with one quarter of respondents rating this highly in 2002, in contrast to only 5% in 1982. The percentage of students who valued the access to amenities and sports facilities more than tripled from 5% to 18% in 2002, by which time this factor had become the third most common reason for choosing a university.
The location was also a significant consideration and the percentage of students who paid attention to this did not change remarkably (16% in 2002 and 19% in 1982). In contrast, there was a dramatic decline in the percentage of students who considered the cost of education from 28% to 5%. Admission criteria, the least frequently mentioned reason, were chosen by a mere 2% and 3% respectively in there years.
Overall, reputation and facilities became increasingly important considerations for college students in the UK while costs were less concern.

The bar charts compare students of different ages in terms of what motivates them to study and the support they receive from employers.
Young people study primarily to further their careers, wtih up to 80% of those under the age of 26 studying for this purpose. This figure is significantly higher than the proportion of those who study out personal interet. The gap between these two proportions narrows as students get older, and the figures for those aged 40 to 49 are the same (40%). Students aged over 49 overwhelmingly study for interest (70%), rather than for career (under 20%).
Around 60% of students aged under 26 receive support from employers for further education. The figure drops steadily with age, and only one third of those 30-to-39-year-old students are supported by employers. In contrast, older students, namely, those in their forties and those aged 50 or more, are more likely to gain support (35% and 42% respectively).
Overall, younger students are more likely to study for career purpose, while their older counterparts are more motivated by personal interest. Employers give more support to younger students than to employees of other ages.

The line graph shows the amount of energy consumed in the US from 1980 to 2012, as well as projected consumption to 2030.
Petrol and oil are the most important energy sources throughout the period, and despite fluctuation in the first 15 years, the consumption of these two fuels rose steadily, and this is projected to persis, reaching 50 q in 2030. Coal was as important as natural gas before 2015, but the gap between these two fuels is likely to widen. While the amout of coal consumed is predicted to climb to 30 q in 2030, the figure for natural gas will possibly remain stable at 25 q.
Other fuel sources are less significant. Nuclear power consumption saw a steady increase to around 8 q in 2005 and maintained this level until 2015, after which the level of consumption will not experience any remarkable change. The use of solar / wind and hydropower is limited, and hydropower is the only fuel source which is predicted to fall back to the 1980 figure.
Overall, fossil fuels will make up a large proportion of the energy consumption in the US, whereas renewable resources and nuclear energy will remain insignificant.

People's life expectancy has increased in many socities, possibly because of improvements in technology and the increase in personal wealth, Although senior citizens can contribute extraordinarily to society, I would argue that this demographic change can bring about some problems.
One problem associated with an ageing population is that health care costs will increase, imposing a burden on taxpayers.
The slow pace of work is another problem, as the number of senior workers increases.
In conclusion.

Watching televison (especially informative television) has been recognised as an effective method of learning, because audio-visual information can attract students' attention and engage their interest. Although many TV programmes have educational value, I don't agree that increasing screen time is a good idea.
Television viewing can interfere with children's studies and other activities which can benefit these children's development. 
Another problem is that excessive screen time can affect children's health.
On the other hand, I understand that televison has exposed children to a world of knowledge.
To summarise, I would argue that.
