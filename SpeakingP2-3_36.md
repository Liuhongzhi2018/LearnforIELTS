Part 2

36.   Describe an important event you celebrated. 

You should say:
What the event was
When it happened
Who attended the event
And explain how you feel about the event

An event that I celebrated that I really enjoyed was the birthday of my friend, Lala. She is a really fun and inspiring girl, who always chooses to do things a bit differently to other people I know. She held a special birthday party, which she arranged totally by herself – and invited a few of us. It started in the afternoon at the opening of an art gallery which belonged to one of her friends – there were snacks, wine, some talks about art, and some really fascinating and interesting people there.

Then five of us moved on to a restaurant nearby, a Yunnan restaurant, and had a fantastic meal. She loves the more tropical-themed places of south China so she almost always chooses restaurants like this. After eating and presenting her with her cake and gifts, we went to a jazz club where we had cocktails and sat and watched some live jazz music.

The singer was incredible. We stayed there until the very end, then moved on to a nightclub which was more loud and raucous and much less sophisticated – but by this point we were pretty drunk and wanted to let our hair down and have fun and dance. So we danced for hours, almost until dawn, actually.

It was a fantastic occasion, and I enjoyed how varied the day was, and how I met and chatted with so many interesting and random, cool people. Lala is a great friend and I’m really looking forward to her next birthday, actually! I felt great about the whole day and it gave me a renewed inspiration for life in my city – especially as I had been feeling quite down about things at the time.

Part 3

36.1. Do you like to celebrate important events? Why?

I can take it or leave it. If it is a personal event, I would expect a proper celebration with my family and friends. For example, I am fond of participating birthday parties and wedding anniversaries, things like that. However, if it is a national event, I would rather stay at home than join the crowd outdoors.
Since congestion caused by a large population on these occasions is usually insufferable.

It would be fun to celebrate something in order to reduce stress in life. I believe celebrations are a great chance for people to socialise. For example, my friends and I have little free time, and we can only see each other during special celebrations.

Taking part in national celebrations is a way of showing people's patriotism, to show how much they love their country. It's a good idea for all citizens in the same country celebrate something together, and I believe it helps to improve the strength of the whole country.
