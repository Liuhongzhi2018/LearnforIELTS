Part 2

36.   Describe an important event you celebrated. 

You should say:
What the event was
When it happened
Who attended the event
And explain how you feel about the event

An event that I celebrated that I really enjoyed was the birthday of my friend, Lala. She is a really fun and inspiring girl, who always chooses to do things a bit differently to other people I know. She held a special birthday party, which she arranged totally by herself – and invited a few of us. It started in the afternoon at the opening of an art gallery which belonged to one of her friends – there were snacks, wine, some talks about art, and some really fascinating and interesting people there.

Then five of us moved on to a restaurant nearby, a Yunnan restaurant, and had a fantastic meal. She loves the more tropical-themed places of south China so she almost always chooses restaurants like this. After eating and presenting her with her cake and gifts, we went to a jazz club where we had cocktails and sat and watched some live jazz music.

The singer was incredible. We stayed there until the very end, then moved on to a nightclub which was more loud and raucous and much less sophisticated – but by this point we were pretty drunk and wanted to let our hair down and have fun and dance. So we danced for hours, almost until dawn, actually.

It was a fantastic occasion, and I enjoyed how varied the day was, and how I met and chatted with so many interesting and random, cool people. Lala is a great friend and I’m really looking forward to her next birthday, actually! I felt great about the whole day and it gave me a renewed inspiration for life in my city – especially as I had been feeling quite down about things at the time.

Part 3

36.1. Do you like to celebrate important events? Why?

I can take it or leave it. If it is a personal event, I would expect a proper celebration with my family and friends. For example, I am fond of participating birthday parties and wedding anniversaries, things like that. However, if it is a national event, I would rather stay at home than join the crowd outdoors.
Since congestion caused by a large population on these occasions is usually insufferable.

It would be fun to celebrate something in order to reduce stress in life. I believe celebrations are a great chance for people to socialise. For example, my friends and I have little free time, and we can only see each other during special celebrations.

Taking part in national celebrations is a way of showing people's patriotism, to show how much they love their country. It's a good idea for all citizens in the same country celebrate something together, and I believe it helps to improve the strength of the whole country.

36.2. What kind of events do people usually celebrate?

There are quite a few personal events that people usually celebrate but I think the most common ones are people’s birthdays and their graduation dates. Obviously, everybody loves to celebrate their birthdays, as it is a whole day spent celebrating them. Birthdays are always lovely occasions. Yet, people also often celebrate their graduations as this is a day of significant achievement fbr them, and thus deserves to be celebrated. People usually celebrate milestones of personal achievement.

36.3. Do people often celebrate events with a large group of people or just a few people?

For older people, family parties in my country are mostly organised to celebrate a special occasion and to spend some quality time with the people we care about. For instance, we invite our relatives, friends, colleagues and neighbours to our house to rejoice a family member's birthday, engagement, marriage anniversary or graduation day. We often like to gather on such a party to celebrate a religious festival, to congratulate someone’s promotion or to welcome a newborn baby.

For the young, they prefer holding parties with a large group of friends. When friends are together at a party, they shout, listen to loud music, do not care about strict manners and often go wild. These are not the case in a family party where our parents and elder relatives are present.

36.4. Do people often celebrate festivals with families?

Yes, they do. People usually celebrate festivals with families, such as Spring Festival. They will have a great dinner during the Spring Festival evening and, at the same time, enjoy the Spring Festival Gala held by CCTV. You know, the routine hasn't changed since I was a kid, but I enjoy the quality time with them.

Our daily schedules keep us away from our close friends and relatives. Festivals bring us together, it gives a good time to rejoice and built strong bonds between everyone. Celebrating festivals with everyone can help our kids to meet and greet everyone as well as they can learn the importance of togetherness. It brings us closer to everyone and makes our time wonderful and spiritual.
