A large foreign companies C grow their economies
A develop local companies C grow their economies


## 练习 Advertisements

Some people think personal happiness is directly related to economic success, while others believe this depends on other factors. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion. 

A 经济发展  B 生活很好  C 快乐
A 满足个人的追求  B 有成就感  C 快乐
A 经济发展  B 人们选择更多  C 快乐

Happiness： well-being, satisfaction, contentment, pleasure, lead a happy life, sense of happiness, level of happiness.

Relared to: depend on, hinge on, decided by, 

Economic success: economic growth, economic prosperity, economic boost, a strong economy, a healthy economy, in economically developed/advanced countries

Factors: non-economic factors

Economic prosperity is believed to play a key role in the level of happiness people experience. I agree with this view, although some other factors can come into play in some circumstances. 

（A 满足个人的追求（哪怕经济不好）  B 有成就感  C 快乐）
（解释A-B：每个人的才华不同，展现自己的才华，得到别人的认可）
（解释A-B：每个人的价值观也不同，通过帮助别人，让社会更好）
（解释B-C：觉得人生过得很有价值）

People in a prosperous country may have a higer level of happiness since they live comfortably. They have more wealth to meet different needs, such as favourite clothes, gourmet food they intend to taste, comfortable housing and entertainment that can bring pleasure. Money not only gives them a sense of contentment arising from worldly possessions, but also frees them from stresses of poverty.

（A 经济发展  B 生活很好  C 快乐）
（解释A-B：有钱可以满足各种需求）
（解释B-C：可以享受不同的东西带来满足感，不用去承受物质的负担）

On the other hand, some people think some non-economic factors such as fulfilling one's ambitions affect the level of happiness as they have a sense of achievement. They feel happy when receiving positive social recognition in cases where they display their talents, for example, by pursuing their favourite profession or hobbies. Abother common source of happiness is doing something to contribute to society, such as doing volunteer work, which matches their personal values. They find deep contentment in life as they live a rewarding life, despite not living in a rich country. 

（A 经济发展  B 人们选择更多  C 快乐）
（解释A-B：有钱之后人们可以选择自己想过的生活）
（解释B-C：觉得人生过得很有意义，很丰富）

In my view, a strong economy is a predictor of elevated life satisfaction as people have more choices in their lives. This is understandable considering that every option incurs costs. Those who have considerable savings can possibly resign from their jobs and travel with their family or donate money to disadvantaged people. These experiences can boost their well-being as they think their lives are meaningful and their spiritual, social as well as emotional needs are all fulfilled. All these aspirations could remain unfulfilled if they lived in an impoverished country.

In conclusion, I personally think economic success is a deciding factor of happiness although some other factors may also have an influence.
