Advertisements： commercials, advertising, advertising campaigns, advertisers, advertising firms, marketers.

Encourage: persuade, sway, influence, brainwash

Consumers: the public, shoppers, buyers, people, intended consumers, target market, customers/clients

Buy in qunantity: spend lavishly on, shopping spree, shopaholics, compulsive shopping, shop excessively, buy more than they need

Promote quality: pay attention to quality, focus on quality, durable, keep for long, as good as new, made of good material, meet practical needs, perform functions 

There are concerns that shoppers today have been persuaded to buy more than they need and pay less attention to quality. This is very likely to happen in the modern world, although this may not be true in some cases (although consumers are more sensible when buying some products). 


（A 广告强调购买是社会需求 B 人们不断购买才可以获得快乐 C 买买买）
（解释A-B：人是社会动物，他们很在意身边人的看法和习惯，他们希望遵守某些习惯来获得归属感）

Advertising explore consumers' social needs to induce them to overspend by conveying the message (since buyers tend to believe) that they can derive pleasure from this shopping habit. 

People are social animals, who are sensitive to opinions of their peers and prone to conform to the norms of groups they think they belong to. 

Advertisers take advantage of this psychological trait and portray a product or service as trendy, so more people make the same purchase. Sometimes, some products are marketed as markers of a social class or group, so members of this group usually pursue the ownership of these goods such as hi-tech gadgets, stylish outfits and high-end cosmetics that are popular among high-income earners. These buyers pay less attention to whethers these products are durable or safe.

（A 广告关注我们的实际需求 B 强调产品符合我们的需求 C 推广质量）
（解释A-B：人们很多时候还是很关心自己的预算，因为经济不好，生活成本高）

Advertising firms pay more attention to the quality of their items, since they tend to produce advertisements that shows their products can satisfy shoppers needs. On the other hand, advertising firms sometimes draw attention to the quality of brands they promote, since it is the top concern for the target market. 

These consumers are cost-conscious in a world they find it different to cover living expenses and adapt to an unstable economy. They tend to purchase products of high quality, which have a long lifespan and represent a good value for money, including household appliances, cars and electronic goods. Advertisers can provide test results of independent inspectors to show the performance, which  can boost the confidence of the public. (Consumers usually take their budget into consideration since the economic decline and high living expenses. There consumers are cost-conscious in a world where they find it difficult to cover living expenses and adapt to an unstable economy.)

The working class do not purchase a large quantity of goods they cannot keep for long, due to the fact that are less conscious of social comparison.
