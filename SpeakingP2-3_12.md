12.     Describe a movie you watched recently and would like to watch again. 

You should say:

The film I wanna talk about is A beautiful Mind. It's a biographical drama film based on the life of the American mathematician John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics.

The movie is about a math genius who struggles with mental disorder for decades. At some point in life, He stops taking medication and eventually manages to deal with his erratic symptoms with the full support and care from his wife.

My decision to watch this masterwork came a bit too late. It was released in 2001, but I didn't see it until last week in my dorm room. I told my tutor I'd watch movies for two consecutive days after submitting my paper and he recommended this film to me.

I think people love this movie for similar reasons. The plot holds the audience spellbound with its unexpected twists and the spectacular performance of the leading actors, especially Russell Crowe. He brings the character to life by avoiding sensationalism and building with small behavioral details. He shows a man who descends into madness and then, unexpectedly, regains the ability to function in the academic world.

The movie was well received by critics and won several academy awards a year later. After watching the movie, I did more research on John Nash and found that for many years he was a recluse, wandering around the campus, talking to no one drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes all by himself. It's just amazing that he managed to defeat the demon trapped inside himself after living with it for such a long time. I'll definitely watch it again soon.

12.3 Are actors or actresses important to moives? Why?

An actor is considered a crucial factor that can uplift the whole project. The character portrayals by the actors are so genuine and keep the audience so emotionally involved with the content.

12.4 Why are there fewer people going to the cinema to watch movies nowadays?

People go to the cinema less for a number of reasons, the first is that the acoustics of home theater is better than the original, people can enjoy the feeling of immersion at home. The second is that the cinema environment is uneven and difficult to meet the various needs of people.
