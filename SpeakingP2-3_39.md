Part 2

39.   Describe a city you would recommend as a nice place to live (not your hometown). 

You should say:
What it is
Where it is
What you know about this place
And explain why you recommend it as a nice place to live

The city I want to live in in the future is Xiamen,a coastal metropolis located in the southeast corner of China,thousands of miles away from here.But the transport is pretty convenient.There are many express trains and several flights to and from there every day.You can easily buy a ticket and have a trip on a whim.

I first learnt about this city from the history textbook back in secondary school,which detailed how it was used as a trading point with foreign businessmen after the opium war.But at that time,it was just another city that I needed to memorize to cope with the exam.After I got enrolled in the university,one of my roommates,who is also my best friend,comes from there,and he is so proud of his hometown,always bragging about its food,beautiful sceneries,fresh air,and advanced economy.

The city is famous for Gulangyu,a small island off its coast and a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.As a place of residence for Westerners during Xiamen’s colonial past,this island is renowned for its architecture and for hosting China’s only piano museum,giving it the nickname of“The Town of Pianos”or“The Island of Music.It is a major domestic tourist destination,attracting more than 10 million visitors per year.

But the reason why I want to live there has little to do with this tourist attraction.Born and upbrought in an inland city,the sea always possesses a mysterious enchantment,luring me to get close to it and live by it.And of course,my friend’s boast also contributes to this idea.It is heaven on earth according to his description.

39.1. Where do people like to live in your country?

In my country, people usually like to live in urban areas because of more employment options, good health, and education facilities.

39.2. Why do many people move to the city?

I think most of the time, work is the driving force that people move to the cities. Since it is difficult to make a daily commute to the workplace from my hometown. Along with this, there are better educational facilities in cities as compared to the villages.

39.3. What are the advantages of living close to the workplace?

The main advantage of having the workplace close to the home is that it saves a lot of time linked to daily travel. Also, it reduces the stress related to reaching work on time.

39.4. What kinds of places do old people prefer to live in?

Older people mostly prefer to live away from the cities. Because they like to live close to nature in peaceful places. Moreover, living expenses are relatively less in the countryside than cities.
