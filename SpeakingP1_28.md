# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

28.     Sitting down

28.1 Where is your favourite place to sit?

Definitely my gaming chair in my home office. I'm in my last year of university and I'm just having too much on my plate right now, you know, multiple projects and essays. Sitting on my gaming chair and playing some video games is the best way to unwind myself.


28.2 Do you always sit down for a long time?

Yes. As I have mentioned, I have many projects and essays to do. I often sit for more than five hours a day just to keep on track. Sometimes I even sit for the entire day.

28.3 Do you feel sleepy when you are sitting down?

Sometimes for sure. I mean, I think everyone will feel the same when they spend hours sitting down with their computer or textbooks. I drink lots of coffee to keep concentrated.

28.4 When you were a kid, did you usually sit on the floor?

I don't think so. My mother is a cleaning freak, and she prohibits me from sitting on the floor because it is not hygienic.
