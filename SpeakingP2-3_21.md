Part 2

21.   Describe a person you know who loves to grow plants (e.g. vegetables / fruits / flowers etc.). 

You should say:

What he/she grows
Where he/she grows them
And explain why he/she enjoys growing plants

Gardening is becoming a very popular hobby in my country in recent years. I know many people who like to do gardening. However, today I am going to talk about my grandfather because I learnt about growing plants from him.

My grandfather started this hobby after retirement. He retired from China Agricultural University as a lecturer, so he had pretty good knowledge about plants. However, he never got much time, before retirement.

His house has a big backyard, so there is a lot of open space to grow plants. He started with flowers like roses and jasmine. Then he planted some fruit trees like apples, oranges, and pomegranates. Now, he has a kitchen garden, and he grows all his vegetables by himself.

There are a lot of pesticides and chemicals being used in farming nowadays. So, he doesn’t like to buy vegetables from the market. Although organically grown vegetables are also available in the market nowadays, their prices are too high currently. I also feel that the vegetables grown by him have a different taste. Maybe it is because instead of using chemicals, he uses kitchen waste as compost.

I guess I don’t have much of a green thumb，every year I plant cabbage, beans and sweet corn in my backyard but all I ever get is a lot of weeds. During corona time, however, I had a lot of free time and so I learnt a bit of gardening from my grandpa. That’s when I came to know about his love for gardening and how much knowledge he had. For example, he taught me how to safely and naturally deal with common pests, diseases, and weeds that can wreak havoc on the garden.

In the beginning, I started with just a few tomatos. But with grandpa’s guidence, now I can do really well in planting, caring for, and harvesting several kinds of vegetables. I guess this is the most fulfilling part for a gardener.

21.1. Are there many people growing their own vegetables now?

Growing your own produce in your garden is a simple way to ensure you always have fresh, delicious fruits and vegetables at your fingertips. The cost of living crisis has prompted some people to cut food bills by growing their own fruit and vegetables. Main idea: Developing a green thumb is a way to pass the time for some people.

21.2. Do you think it's good to let kids learn how to plant?

Planting activities foster the spirit of exploration. For children, the natural environment can more directly support their independent exploration, and planting activities are real and natural, vibrant and varied. Planting activities foster a sense of responsibility in children, and they are happy to see the seedlings grow up. At the same time, when they see the seedlings growing worms, they can actively think of ways to protect the bean seedlings, which is their sense of responsibility and love, and through this method they can develop their sense of responsibility.

21.3. What do you think of the job of a farmer?

Farmer is an ancient occupation, and it is one of the ancient occupations for the survival of early human society. Human survival necessitated the need for food, and human development was largely determined by the ancient occupation of farmer.

21.4. What are the differences between traditional and modern agriculture?

Agriculture is a huge industry that has evolved throughout time. Agriculture includes the art and science of cultivating plants, animals, fungi, and other life forms with natural resources such as water, soil, air, and sunlight to provide food for humans. Traditional agriculture relies on methods such as crop rotation or hand weeding which can be difficult to maintain in today’s world where there are more than 7 billion people on Earth vying for increasingly scarce land and resources. Modern agriculture uses mechanized equipment like tractors and combines to harvest crops quickly which saves labor costs but may not produce food as efficiently or environmentally friendly as traditional farming methods.
