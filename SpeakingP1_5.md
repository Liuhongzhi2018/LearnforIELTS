# Lesson 9

口语 Part 1

5. The area you live in

5.1 Do you like the area that you live in?

I do like the area I live in. My living place is in the city’s downtown area. Well, there are several tasty restaurants around my apartment, which is great for a foodie like me. And we also have a giant grocery store across the street and the well-known Xuanwu Lake nearby. So I have to say it’s a pretty livable place.

5.2 Where do you like to go in that area?

I like to go to the well-known Xuanwu Lake that sits near out university. It is an important part of the Nanjing landscape. It is AAAA national tourist attraction, collects many places of interests and historical relics. Historical litterateur figures as Li Bai and Wang Anshi set foot here and left behind many poems in admiration of the lake. On the isle, there are rockeries with falls. We can see both the ancient wall of Nanjing, along with the modern skyscrapers in the background.
