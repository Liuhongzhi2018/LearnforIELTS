# Lesson 9

口语 Part 1

5. The area you live in

5.1 Do you like the area that you live in?

I do like the area I live in. My living place is in the city’s downtown area. Well, there are several tasty restaurants around my apartment, which is great for a foodie like me. And we also have a giant grocery store across the street and the well-known Xuanwu Lake nearby. So I have to say it’s a pretty livable place.

5.2 Where do you like to go in that area?

I like to go to the well-known Xuanwu Lake that sits near out university. It is an important part of the Nanjing landscape. It is AAAA national tourist attraction, collects many places of interests and historical relics. Historical litterateur figures as Li Bai and Wang Anshi set foot here and left behind many poems in admiration of the lake. On the isle, there are rockeries with falls. We can see both the ancient wall of Nanjing, along with the modern skyscrapers in the background. 

5.3 Do you know any famous people in your area?

Actually yes! I am aware that a lot of movie stars come from where I live. I feel very proud every time I see them in a fantastic film. Also, there are some poets and writers who are living in the area that I come from. So, I suppose my city is an artistic and poetic area.

5.4 What are some changes in the area recently?

Well, a lot of changes are taking place nowadays in my city. I can see more and more skyscrapers having been built and the public transportation system is becoming more diversified and completed. But for me, the most fantastic change is that there is greater diversity in restaurants! Now I can taste genuine foreign food in my city. How marvelous it is.

5.5 Do you know any of your neighbours?

No, actually I don’t know any of the people in my apartment building. But I think that’s quite normal these days when you live in a big city like I do.
