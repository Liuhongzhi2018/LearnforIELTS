Part 2

25.   Describe a time when you helped a child. 

You should say:
When it is?
How you helped him/her?
Why you helped him/her?
And how you felt about it.

Helping is the most beautiful quality of a human being one should help others whenever it is needed or required. Especially children, they are so curious to learn everything. We should always help them in their academics and extracurricular activities.

Here I am going to talk about a time when I helped a kid. It was my vacation time and I was chilling on a beach with my family and I was having a wonderful time with my family.

On the beach I saw one small kid trying to make a sand house. He was struggling to make it. I observed him failing many times. The mud was not shaping according to him. And I decided to help him make a sand house.

I like helping kids and I especially help them when I find them struggling. And when I saw him failing in making a sand house I immediately went and sit with I also started making a new one just beside him. When he joined me we together made a wonderful sand house. That kid kept continuously talking about different shapes he wanted in the house and I tried to make them.

At the end we finally did it. We made a wonderful sand house together and saw a victory smile on his face and I lived my childhood once again. It was such a satisfying movement. His parents were watching us doing this when we completed the house. They also came with us and we clicked some photographs.

Part 3


25.1. Do you often help kids? How?

Yes, I do. I love helping kids. I have realised it gives a lot of mental satisfaction and happiness.

25.2. Why is it necessary to do volunteer services?

Volunteering seems to have become an important part of the way we live today. Volunteering is important because it provides vital help to noble causes, less privileged communities, and communities as a whole. Since many NGOs or charities are partially funded by the government, they cannot afford to pay their full-time staff, so they often depend on the kindly demeanor of volunteers.

Volunteer service embodies a kind of people's desire to participate in society, and in the process of volunteering, people can learn more about society and exercise their abilities. Since the spirit of volunteerism has the function of motivation, through various external stimuli, it can make people produce an enterprising spirit with high motivation and morale, so spreading this volunteer spirit is undoubtedly a good way of positive behavior.

25.3. What can schools do to develop students' awareness of volunteering?

Schools can promote this spirit to students by organizing commendation conferences and reports of advanced deeds; colleges can also motivate more college students to participate in volunteer services through spiritual honor awards, such as issuing corresponding honor certificates for students who participate in volunteer services.

25.4. Who benefit more from the volunteer services, the volunteers or the people helped?

Volunteering is first of all a way to improve oneself and to get oneself saved. I have seen many people who are depressed and pessimistic when they are addicted to the realm of self and cannot go out, but when they open their heart and start to help others and go to the society, finally they can save themselves.
