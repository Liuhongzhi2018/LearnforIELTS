# Lesson 9 Pie chat (Simon)

## Note

Pie charts can show numbers but they always show percentages. And they can show changes over time (e.g. years)

Your job is to compare the percentages (and numbers).

First, make a very general comparison
(summary / overview paragraph)
Second, compare specific numbers
(details paragraphs)

Introduction - paraphrase the question

The pie charts compare five categories of household expenditure in the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.

Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

It is noticeable that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. Also, UK residents spent a significantly larger percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand countries.

Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the lines

In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand househould budget went on food and drink, while the equivalent figure for a UK home was 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. By contrast, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.

Leisure activities accounted for the highest proportion of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders spent only half as much in relative terms on recreation (17%) as UK residents (34%). In both countries, transport costs and other costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.

## Tips 

Don't describe each country or year separately.
Compare countries and years together.
Mention all 5 categories.
Divide the categories into two groups for the two details paragraphs.
The category called Other is not important.
Don't write Leisure was 34%.
Write Households spent 34% of their money on leisure.
