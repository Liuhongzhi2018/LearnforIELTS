# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

29.   Talents

29.1 Do you have a talent or something you are good at?

Yes. I'm quite good at math and most things related to math, such as creating budgets, calculating investment returns, and so on. I think it's a useful talent because it helps me manage my personal finances.


29.2 Was it mastered recently or when you were young?

I don't think I would ever master it, but I discovered it when I was young. I've always achieved high math grades a everything else just became natural to me.


29.3 Do you think your talent can be useful for your future work? Why?

That's a good question. Perhaps. Artists don't usually make that much money unless they are really popular and successful. So if I want to become rich, then it's certainly not so useful. However, in terms of career, I could focus on graphic design and illustration. I might be able to combine my talent with a fairly lucrative career that way.


29.4 Do you think anyone in your family has the same talent?

Surprisingly, no one shares the same talent with me. So, it is not something that runs in blood. Because they all hate math, they often come to me for financial advice.
