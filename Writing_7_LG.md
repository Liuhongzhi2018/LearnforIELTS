# Lesson 7 Line Graph (Simon)

## Note

You will almost definitely see 2, 3, 4 or 5 lines.

Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.

First, make a very general comparison
(summary / overview paragraph)
e.g., the blue line is the highest overall and it is higher than the other lines overall in the whole period shown.

Seond, compare the lines at specific points, write at least one thing about each line.
(details paragraphs 3 and 4)
e.g., at the beginning with the fisrt year, the point where the blue line becomes the highest and stay highest in the rest of period, the different increases or rises, the peaks on one or more of the lines, a stable period on one of the lines like.


## 练习 electricity production

Introduction - paraphrase the question

Question: The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.

Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the lines

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. Just one year later, nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.


## Vocabulary

electricity production: amount of electricity produced, source of / provided / generating electricity, means of electricity generation

years: over a period of / over the period shown, by far the most important, a negligible amount

## US energy consume

The line graph shows the amount of energy consumed in the USA from 1908 to 2012, as well as projected consumption to 2030.

Petrol and oil are the most important energy sources throughout the period, and despite fluctuation in the first 15 years, the consumption of these two fuels rose steadily, and this is projected to persist, reaching 50 q in 2030.
Coal was as important as natural gas before 2015, but the gap between these two fuels is likely to widen. While the amount of coal consumed is projected to climb to 30 q in 2030, the figure for natural gas will possibly remain stable at 25q.

Other fuel sources are less significant. Nuclear power consumption saw a steady increase to around 8 q in 2005 and maintained this level until 2015, after which the level of consumption will not experience any remarkable change.
The use of solar/wind and hydropower is limited, and hydropower is the only fuel source which is projected to fall back to the 1980 figure.

Overall, fossil fuels will make up a large proportion of the energy consumption in the US, whereas renewable resources and nuclear energy will remain insignificant.
