## 练习 Advertisements

Advertisements encourage consumers to buy in qunantity rather than promote quality. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

金钱角度：
A 广告强调购买是社会需求 B 人们不断购买才可以获得快乐 C 买买买
A 广告利用我们的情感需求 B 人们不断购买才可以获得快乐 C 买买买
A 广告关注我们的实际需求 B 强调产品符合我们的需求 C 推广质量

Advertisements： commercials, advertising, advertising campaigns, advertisers, advertising firms, marketers.

Encourage: persuade, sway, influence, brainwash

Consumers: the public, shoppers, buyers, people, intended consumers, target market, customers/clients

Buy in qunantity: spend lavishly on, shopping spree, shopaholics, compulsive shopping, shop excessively, buy more than they need

Promote quality: pay attention to quality, focus on quality, durable, keep for long, as good as new, made of good material, meet practical needs, perform functions 

There are concerns that shoppers today have been persuaded to buy more than they need and pay less attention to quality. This is very likely to happen in the modern world, although this may not be true in some cases (although consumers are more sensible when buying some products). 


（A 广告强调购买是社会需求 B 人们不断购买才可以获得快乐 C 买买买）
（解释A-B：人是社会动物，他们很在意身边人的看法和习惯，他们希望遵守某些习惯来获得归属感）

Advertising explore consumers' social needs to induce them to overspend by conveying the message (since buyers tend to believe) that they can derive pleasure from this shopping habit. 

People are social animals, who are sensitive to opinions of their peers and prone to conform to the norms of groups they think they belong to. 

Advertisers take advantage of this psychological trait and portray a product or service as trendy, so more people make the same purchase. Sometimes, some products are marketed as markers of a social class or group, so members of this group usually pursue the ownership of these goods such as hi-tech gadgets, stylish outfits and high-end cosmetics that are popular among high-income earners. These buyers pay less attention to whethers these products are durable or safe.

（A 广告关注我们的实际需求 B 强调产品符合我们的需求 C 推广质量）
（解释A-B：人们很多时候还是很关心自己的预算，因为经济不好，生活成本高）

Advertising firms pay more attention to the quality of their items, since they tend to produce advertisements that shows their products can satisfy shoppers needs. On the other hand, advertising firms sometimes draw attention to the quality of brands they promote, since it is the top concern for the target market. 

These consumers are cost-conscious in a world they find it different to cover living expenses and adapt to an unstable economy. They tend to purchase products of high quality, which have a long lifespan and represent a good value for money, including household appliances, cars and electronic goods. Advertisers can provide test results of independent inspectors to show the performance, which  can boost the confidence of the public. (Consumers usually take their budget into consideration since the economic decline and high living expenses. There consumers are cost-conscious in a world where they find it difficult to cover living expenses and adapt to an unstable economy.)

The working class do not purchase a large quantity of goods they cannot keep for long, due to the fact that are less conscious of social comparison.


## 练习 Education

As part of education, students should spend a period of time studying and living in a different country to learn a different language and culture. Do you agree or disagree?

education: the learning process

As part of education: an important part/component of education, a building block

students: learners

spend a period of time: spend serveral months, serveral weeks

study: take/attend some couses, receive training

live: stay in, integrate into, assimilate into the local culture

learn a different language and cultur: pick up/accuquire/have a good command of/use a foreign language, learn about a different culture

Some people argue that a key part of language acquisition is staying in a country where this language is spoken. I partly agree with this view, although for some students, there is an alternative approach.

（全球化角度： A 留学 B 深入了解生活各个方面和相关单词 C 学习外语和文化）
（解释A-B：使用当地的资源、设施等等，无可避免地接触当地的语言）
（解释B-C：积累一些当地人使用的词汇，了解他们的一些习惯、态度、信仰、看法）

Going to a foreign country is an effective way to become culturally and linguistically competent because students have to integrate into the local community. Their exposure to the target language is inevitable considering that they cannot live without resourses and facilities of the host community. They have to communite with locals in every aspect of daily lives, including buying groceries, renting a house, using public transport, attending courses and opening a bank account, thereby accumulating locally-used vocabulary. Onging communication also deepens their understanding of the habits, attitudes, beliefs and thoughts of people native to a specific country, which make its culture distinct from others.

（全球化角度： A 留学 B 尽量融入当地社区，了解交流习惯 C 学习外语和文化）

（科技角度： A 不出去留学 B 使用其他资料 C 一样学习外语和文化）
（解释A-B：网络时代，有大量的材料，网课、字典、书籍等等）
（解释B-C：通过搜索功能，获得相关信息进行学习）

On the other hand, going abroad should not be made compusory for everybody since there are alternative ways to achieve the same purpose. Some people cannot afford the cost of studying overseas. Nor do they consider it necessary to learn a language in depth. Acquiring a language can be attained on the web, where learners can find a wealth of resources, such as online courses, live lessions, digital dictionaries and e-books. They can use the search engine to locate relevant information to gain knowledge, not only idioms and slang but also customs and cultural norms of a country.

In conclusion, I would argue that going overseas allows for in-depth language learning, , including an insight into cultural differences, although using Internet resources can be an alternative for those who do not expect to become competent language users.

## 练习 Learning a foreign language

Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Many may say, and I agree, that today's society has almost erased all its boarders and soon will become limitless in what concerns travelling for both work and pleasure. Therefore, if this is to happen, then leaning a new language is necessary.

Nowadays, leaning a new language for the purpose of working in other countries seems to become more and more popular. Adults in need of money or, why not, recognision are trying to pursue their happiness far away from home. Also, the hey days of employers looking only for capable people have gone. It seems that today's employers are looking not only for multi-skilled employees, but they also want people who know more than their mother tongue. Sooner or later, those who omitted learning more are prone to become jobless.

However, to my mind, a new language shouldn't be leaned just for travelling or working in a foreign country. A foreign language should help the learner broaden his mind. But this I mean that the new language should and will allow us to understand more about the world itself, and maybe our ancestors' ways of thinking and acting. Needless to say, knowing another language will help us when it comes to understanding the human race, because language is the first poem of a country.

All of this being said, I believe that learning a different language should be not only for satisfying our physical needs, like money, but also our moral needs, because never before had such a big thirst for knowledge been displayed.

参考译文：

很多人可能会说，当然我也认同，即当今的社会几乎已经抹掉了所有的边界，并且很快那些在工作或休闲旅游中的担忧将不复存在。因此，如果这将发生，那么学外语将成为一种必须。

现在，为了在其他国家工作而学习外语已经变得越来越流行。那些需要钱的或为了认知的成年人试图在远离家的地方追寻幸福。而且，雇主只招聘那些有能力的员工的全盛时期已经过去了。现在的雇主不仅仅招聘多元能力的，还希望有会多种语言的员工。很快，那些不愿学习的人很有可能会失业。

然而，就我而言，学习外语不应该仅仅只是为了在国外旅行或工作。一门外语应该能帮助学习者开阔眼界。这么说是因为新的语言应该并且将会让我们更好地理解世界本身，甚至理解我们先人的思维方式和行为。更不用说，学另一门语言还能有助于我们理解人类，因为语言是国家的第一首诗。

基于所有以上提到的，我认为学外语不应该仅仅为了满足我们的生理需要，比如钱，也应该考虑精神需求，因为以前从未有如此大的对知识的渴求被展示出来。


## 练习 Unpaid community service

Some people believe that ... . To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Introduction-2 sentences(5 minutes)

It is sometimes argue that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities. I completely agree that this kind of scheme would be a good idea. (In my opinion, it would be wrong to force teenagers to do any kind of unsalaried work. / While I disagree with the idea of making such programmes compulsory, I do believe that voluntary community service could benefit young people.) 

Two main paragraphs-5 sentences each(20 minutes)

There are several reasons why I would argue against having compulsory community service for secondary school students. Firstly, the school curriculum is already full with important academic subjects, such as maths, science and languages. For example, I remember having an extremely busy timetable when I was at hign school, and it would not have been possible to add to it. Secondly, students' performance in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were taken by charity work or neighbourhood improvemnet schemes. Finally, I believe that teenager students would be reluctant to take part in any programme of obligatory work, and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour. 

On the other hand, the opportunity to do voluntary community service could be extremely positive for high school students. By making these progrmames optional, schools would ensure that only motivated students took part. These young people would gain valuable experience in an adult working environment, which could help to build their self confidence and enhance their skills. Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve school leavers' career prospects. For example, a period of voluntary work experience might impress a university admission officer or a future employer. 

Conclusion-1 sentence(5 minutes)
