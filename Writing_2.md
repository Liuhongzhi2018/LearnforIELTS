## 练习

University and colleges are now offering qualifications through distance learning from the Internet rather than face-to-face interaction in the classroom. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?

University and colleges: higher education, tertiary education, educational institutions/establishments

offering qualifications: provide courses, run courses, deliver courses, give opportunities to obtain degrees/certificates/diplomas

distance learning: online learning, online education/courses, on the Internet

interation: communication, teaching, give instructions

classroom: lecture hall, classroom settings/environment, traditional settings

Many young people today attend online courses to obtain a degree without going to lectures in person. The advantages of this move certainly outweigh its disadvantages.

Online courses may have better learning outcomes for some people because they are an efficient way of receiving education. These courses minimise the time students spend going to lecture halls, thereby increasing study hours. Online lessons are also recorded, meaning that students can pause, rewind and forward a lecture as they like. They can focus their attention to key concepts, theories and information, which can be digested more effectively. In contrast, lectures in traditional classrooms distribute time evenly to each chapter, possibly not suitable for students of different levels and needs.

Online education also provides valuable opportunities to advance one's career because it offers considerable flexibility. Those who sign up for there courses can watch lessons whenever and wherever it is convenient. They do not need to take a career break or make other personal sacrifices to pursue a degree since they do not need to go to another city or country. The overall cost of obtaining a qualification is relatively small, as it does not incur travel and accommodation expenses. A strong academic background paves the way for a brilliant career in modern times, when knowledge is a key driver of economic growth.


（A B只能关注知识本身，C学到的东西有限）

On the other hand, distance learning may not be able to yield some benefits of education in traditional settings as it(online education) conveys knowledge only. Participants of this programme give priority to the content of each lecture, or even assessmenets, which decide whether they can graduate. They miss out on the opportunity to study with excellent peers and receive instructions from renowned scholars, from whom they can draw inspiration in styles of communication, study habits, dedication and character. The qualities of these role models sometimes make a stronger impact than qualifications.

In conclusion, Internet-based education can improve career prospects for many although it may not replicate conventional means of receiving education in every benefit.
