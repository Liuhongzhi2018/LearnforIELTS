Part 2

2.  Describe a friend from your childhood. 

You should say:
Who he/she is
Where and how you met each other
What you often did together
And explain what made you like him/her

A childhood friend of mine is Jackie, who was my most intimate friend during my entire childhood. We began to know about each other since my family has settled down in my hometown and we became neighbors. We were first introduces by our parents when both of us were about to stay alone at home since our parents were quite busy at that time and they wanted us to play together. We didn't become so familiar until one day on a special occasion we had a common interest in stamps. it was a set of stamps on a stamp album given by his great-grandfather from Singapore that caused my attention on the bookshelf when I was visiting his home. He patiently took out and let me take a look at those stamps, though I didn't have much taste in appreciating the stamps. This album contained a lot of stamps, most of which were collected directly from the envelopes. Well, I think the most important reason why we became so intimate friends during childhood was that we didn't have the so-called gap between us. We could always find something that could arouse out interests and it seemed that time spent together was never enough for us.

Part 3

2.1 Do you still keep in touch with your friends from childhood? Why or why not?

Yes! I still have touch with my childhood friends.It is easy for me because I am still in my native place where I studied and some of my friends are still here and we often meet to chat.Few friends are out of station and we have contacts through phone.Also ,if they come here they dont fail to give a visit.Unless you are moving places for occupational purposes,you dont have to miss your childhood friends.

2.2 Do you prefer to live in the city or in the countryside?

There can be no doubt that one of the greatest gifts in the universe is childhood friendship. No matter how old we get, the playful moments with friends can transport us back to a time when life was carefree and joyful. For children, friendship is a vital part of their mental, physical and social development. Children require opportunities to play together in order to form bonds of friendship. Through friendships, children learn how to negotiate with others in social situations. They also improve their physical health by competing with their peers in games and pushing the boundaries of their physical abilities. Friendships during early childhood are a vital part of a child’s emotional growth and promote good mental health.
