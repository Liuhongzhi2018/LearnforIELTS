Introduction - paraphrase the question

The first flow diagram illustrates the process of glass container production, and the second diagram shows steps in the process of recycling used glass.

Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

We can see that glass is made using three main raw materials, and that the manufacturing process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.

Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the lines

At the first stage in the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals are mixed together. Next, this mixture is heated in a glass furnace at approximately 1500℃ to produce molten glass. The molten glass can then be shaped, by blowing, to create the end products, namely glass containers.

Glass recycling begins with the collection of used glass products. The collected glass is sorted according to its colour, and then washed in order to remove any impurities. At the fourth stage of recycling, the glass is crushed and melted, and the resulting molten glass can finally be moulded to create new items.


## Vocabulary

paraphrase: raw materials, end products, production, manufacturing, are mixed-this mixture, collection-the collected glass, is melted-the resulting molten glass.

steps: steps / stages in the process of, consists of four distinct stages, it requires five steps, at the first stage, next, then, begins with.

## cement and concrete

The two diagram show how cement and concrete are produced with different materials and facilities used.

At the first stage, limestone and clay are crushed by the crusher into powder. The powder is then delivered to the mixer, where it is mixed. The mixture is subsequently sent to the rotating heater, after which it is heated and rotated. In the next step, the rotated powder is placed on the conveyor belt, before being ground by the grinder into cement. This final product is packed in bags.

In the process of the concrete production, gravel accounts for 50% of materials, while cement, water and sand represnt 15%, 10% and 25% respectively. These materials are placed in the concrete mixer, which rotated clockwise until concrete is produced.

To sum up, cement production consists of 4 stages, starting from crushing materials into power and ending at bagging cement. In contrast, concrete production is simple, mixing for materials.
