A 人口增长 B 公共交通发展不够 C 导致道路拥挤
A 发展公共交通 B 更好利用城市的空间 C 解决拥挤的问题

（A 人口增长 B 公共交通发展不够 C 导致道路拥挤）
（解释A-B: 建造公共交通，特别是地铁、修路等等，需要时间，克服一些问题，包括产权问题，钱的划拨等等）
（解释B-C: 人们可能很少去使用公共交通，道路又比较少，就导致道路容量支持不起那么多人）
 
Population explosion has made roads busier than before as public transport fails to keep pace with the demand. Cities has attracted numerous people with robust economic growth and the availablity of amenities, especially in those countries where technological progress and economic prosperity has driven a population boom. Traffic problems are common in there heavily-populated cities, considering that the expansion of public transport services takes time, due to land ownership, allocation of public money and other barriers. The majority of people choose to drive cars or ride a bike, instead of taking the bus or metro, thereby pushing the capacity limit of existing roads.

（A 发展公共交通 B 更好利用城市的空间 C 解决拥挤的问题）
（解释A-B: 发展公共交通可以减少私家车出行，因为费用低、更加准时）
（解释B-C: 公共交通一次可以承载更多的人，道路就会腾出空间）

Public transport is usually more affordable and punctual, which can attract/appeal to/lure people previously driving cars. Buses or trains can carry more passengers than private cars, thereby freeing up road space. 

（A 城市扩张 B 人口分布更广 C 解决拥挤的问题）
（解释A-B: 发展公共交通可以减少私家车出行，因为费用低、更加准时）
（解释B-C: 就近上班，减少主干道的使用量）

Another solution is urban expansion, which allows for wider distribution of the population across a bigger area. For this purpose, it is appropriate to develop some new neighbourhoods, where more people can live and work around. These inhabitants can work for companies near their homes and walk to work, which can reduce the volume of traffic on main roads/arteries leading to the city cantre.
