Part 2

1.    Describe a program you like to watch. 

You should say:
What it is
What it is about
Who you watch it with
And explain why you like to watch it

I wanna talk about a very popular show named Singer. It's a very entertaining singing competition show in China and is based on the Korean show I Am a Singer. It premiered in 2013 and has been running for several seasons.

All the contestants of the show are well-known professional singers from across the globe, mostly Asia and they rotate performing in front of a 500-member audience, who play the role of umpire and determine the results of each round. The singer who receives the fewest votes is eliminated and substituted for a new singer, so the lineup of the show is constantly changing. Another highlight of the show is the eliminated singers are entitled to give a returning performance in the next episode and are likely to return to the competition in the breakout round.

I like to watch the show with my roommates at night when we finish our schoolwork for the day. Sometimes, I'd watch the show alone when I'm eating takeaways. And sometimes the show is broadcast on the TV in our school dining hall and it's amazing to see hundreds of students watching it when having their meals.

I enjoy the show because it's so engaging. When a vocalist is performing a song we are all familiar with, we'd love to sing along and sometimes their performance can be so emotionally charged that the live audience would even shed tears of excitement. Besides, unlike many other competition shows that feature unknown artists and professional coaches, Singer's all-star lineup is what keeps the audience glued to the screen.

Part 3

11.1 What programs do people like to watch in your country?

Well, people are interested in watching TV drama series and reality shows. I feel they are a good source of entertainment, giving people minutes of relaxation after a stressful day.

Well, there are plenty of programs that people like to watch in China. Like girls, they particularly enjoy watching whatever the latest TV programs with those handsome boys. For boys, we prefer watching action movies. Now, you know, the online streaming is quite popular in China, like food blogger, travel blogger and so on. Young people like to spend their time on that. Yeah, that's all I can think of. 

11.2 Do people in your country like to watch foreign TV programs?

Yeah, I believe now we are living in the internet world. I mean everything about movies or new TV programs around the world, as long as it's released, we can watch anytime anywhere. Like the Games of Thrones, which is so popular like two years ago, released its last episode 8. Netitizens in China love to watch this kind of epic and magical series. Besides, South Korean reality shows are the top choices for many girls to watch cause many of their favorite idols are likely to attend these shows. 

11.3 What is the benefits of letting kids watch animal videos than visiting zoos?

Well, let me see. Watching animal videos rather than visiting zoos have a couple of advantages. The first one that I can think of is because kids are actually easy to feel afraid if they see animals in person, so watching them by videos could act as a safer way for them to feel dangers for better preparation for going to the zoos later in life. And considering the Covid pandemic recently, it is also a safer way of seeing animals at the same time while avoiding contacting with other people.

11.4 Do teachers play videos in class in your country?

Well, from my personal experience, we did not have a chance to watch videos in class like 10 years ago, cause our teachers paid great attention to our study, fearing that videos could be a distraction. But now, I believe most of the classrooms in cities are equipped with projector and some other high-tech devices, so teachers are likely to use help from videos to better deliver their classes. Still, not all schools are well fitted with video-playing devices, it is hard to say all teachers will play videos in class.
