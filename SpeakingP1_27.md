27.    Old buildings

27.1 Have you ever seen some old buildings in the city?

Yeah of course, in Chengdu, there are many old buildings that have been well preserved and Actually, some of them are even vibrant. If you go to places like Sino-ocean Taikoo Li Chengdu, It is famous as an urban hub, but the best thing about this place is that it actually has kept its thousand-year-old temple, which I believe is something we should be proud of.

27.2 Do you think we should preserve old buildings in the cities?

If really depends, if we are talking about old buildings that have cultural and historic flavour or some unique architectural style, it should be kept. but when it comes to buildings that are unsafe and in very bad condition(dilapidated), why not just demolish them and build more high-rise building to solve the housing problems in cities?

27.3 Do you prefer living in an old building or a modern house?

Modern house, no doubt. I want to enjoy the conveniences of modern, high-rise buildings, Where I can enjoy the spacious and well-ventilated rooms equipped with modern facilities such as air conditioning and lift. These are something that you can hardly enjoy in an old building, though most old buildings can be refurbished.

27.4 Are there any old buildings you want to see in the future? Why?

Yes, I believe there are some fascinating construction sites in Paris, so I want to visit those places and learn a lot about the churches, museums build buildings. I’m always enthusiastic about history house places.

Yes, there are some old buildings at the place I live which signifies the times my town used to go to war and some items they used. Also, it gives me insight into how the oldies used to build their houses, so I would love to see this particular building stay for long and recommend the people to take good care of it so it doesn’t collapse.
