# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

18.  Technology

18.1  What technology do you often use, computers or cellphones?

Both. I use my laptop to take notes on the classes, complete essays and reports assigned by my teachers and attend online courses.In contrast, my cellphone is mainly used for entertainment, like scrolling through social media and short video platforms and chatting with my friends.

Actually I use both quite often. I use my laptop for many purposes, like taking online courses, working on my assignments and essays, watching movies, and so on. I use my smartphone mostly for social purposes, like chatting with family and friends on wechat, posting photos and short videos on social media, things like that.

Well, my answer is both because I use them every day. Cellphone is obviously like the daily necessity for me, and I use it to send voice messages, binge watch video clips and there are so many apps helping me to solve different problems in life. But it's not so convenient when it comes to word processing, so when I’m at work making an excel spreadsheet, computer is really helpful.

18.2  What electronic devices have you bought lately?

I bought the latest generation of fitness tracker released by Huawei two months ago. It can monitor my sleep and heart rate, track the calories I have burnt, and remind me to stretch my limbs after sitting for too long. I think it would help me develop a healthier lifestyle.

I bought an ipad last month. I used to take my laptop to class for note taking, but it was too bulky. Sometimes I feel like doing some sports after class and it's really inconvenient to carry something so heavy. Ipad is a perfect alternative, because it's much lighter and more portable.

Well, I've bought a video gaming console. I’m actually quite new to gaming and one of my students recommended it to me. And you know what? One of the games called Super Mario has won my heart. I believe it’s gonna be my good company after work in the future.

18.3  Is there any technology you want to buy?

Yes, I want to buy the iPhone 14 pro released by Apple. It is a symbol of fashion and cutting-edge technology. Unfortunately, its price far exceeds my affordability. I have to save money for another half year to bring it home.

I've long set my eyes on a Leica digital camera. I'm really into photography and it's so fun to capture all these wonderful moments and small details that make up my life. The camera I’m currently using has got a few problems, like the photos can get pretty blurry sometimes, so I’m thinking about getting a new one.

Yeah, there's one I wanna buy. It's a transparent stereo box, using some kind of technology to allow the lyrics to float on the screen. What's really amazing is, it can recognize the emotion the music trying to convey, and choose the suitable ways to match the lyrics presenting.

18.4 Is technology important in your life?

Yes, I think so. Technology has benefited my life in various ways. The laptop has substantially boosted my efficiency. The cellphone has facilitated my communication with my friends and families and enriched my entertainment. And all the white appliances, like the washing machines, robot vacuums, microwave ovens, and air conditioners, have made my life more comfortable.

Yeah, technology means a lot because it brings much convenience to my life. And the robot vacuum cleaner is one of the domestic appliances that saves me the trouble of doing the cleaning after work. Plus, wearing three dimensional glasses when watching the film make me feel like, I’m completely in the environment and forget the worries in life.


18.5 Is there any technology you don't like?

Twitter. Very few people are sufficiently brilliant to say anything worthwhile in 140 characters. It breeds an ego that most people are not worthy of. It's sadder still when politicians use it to make a stand on a nuanced issue.

18.6 What do you think are the trends in technology today compared to when you were young?

Devices and gadgets that we use today were radically different in the past. Some of the first gadgets or devices were simple, so big, controversial, or only a few people had access to that gadget, but in this century technologies become simple and everyone has access to it. Mobile Phone. In 1973 Motorola researcher Martin Cooper made the first mobile telephone call using a device weight 1.1 KG and measured 23 centimeters long. It had a talk time of 30 min and took 10hr to recharge. Smart Phone. There are nearly 150 mobile phone manufacturers in the world. You purchase the latest desertion of this device which is small, light, thin, and you can use it as a computer.

18.7. What are the benefits of technology? / Do you think technology is important in your life?

Technology has brought tremendous changes to our lives and we also benefit a great deal from its development. For one thing, we are able to contact our family and friends anytime and anywhere on social apps or through phone calls, unlike previous generations who contact others mostly through letters or fax. On top of that, the convenience of life has greatly improved thanks to the proliferation of various apps.
