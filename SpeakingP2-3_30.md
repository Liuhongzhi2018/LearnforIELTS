30.   Describe an occasion when someone gave you positive advice or suggestions about your work / study. 

You should say:
Who the person is
What he/she said
How the advice/suggestion affected you
And explain how you felt about the advice/suggestion

There are many occasions that I attend with my family and friends. When we have an occasion, we meet our relatives, old friends, or classmates. Here I would like to speak about the marriage occasion of my best friend, in that marriage one of my school friends gave me positive advice.

Last Sunday, we went to my best friend’s marriage. Her name is Rupinder. In her marriage, we all met our classmates. I enjoyed her marriage because of my friends' company. That time I set with one of my friends on the side, and we started discussing our daily routine, and she told me that Shae had started her study after a two-year gap during COVID.

She knew I also wanted to complete my post-graduation, and she encouraged me and told me about her way of studying. She joined online classes and started tuition classes as well. She got a good score and felt proud. I get motivation from her.

After completing the marriage function, I got back to my home and told my mother my friend's story, and my mother took an admission me to college. I started to study. I completed my study in the second division.

Lastly, I would thank my friend for his advice, and I completed my desired education.

30.1. When should parents encourage their children?

Parents can praise and encourage their children at any age. For example, they might praise and encourage a younger child for sharing or for leaving the park when asked. They can praise and encourage a teenage child for coming home at an agreed time, or for starting homework without being reminded. By the way, some children, especially those who are less confident than others, need more encouragement than others.

When a child encounters a troublesome problem and hesitates whether he or she should give up dealing with it, the parents had better encourage their child, because when he or she faces certain difficult things, the child tends to shrink back. If the parents do not encourage their child in time, he or she will choose to avoid the problem. Over time, the child will develop the bad habit of escaping and dare not face the difficulties. For example,
when a child is learning the piano, he or she has made mistakes many times and wants to abandon practice urgently. At this time, parents should embolden their child, and do not let the child lose confidence. Parents' encouragement will give the child strength.

30.2. Should parents always encourage their children?

Yes, of course. People want to be appreciated. Adults are like this; children are even more so. They need more encouragement, which can make children go forward, realize their full potential, and inspire their morale and enthusiasm. When children receive their parents' encouragement, they will deeply feel their parents' affirmation and trust, and this understanding will make the relationship between children and parents more harmonious. Parents' encouragement is conducive to children's mental health. When children are in their growth process, they are psychologically fragile. Supportive parenting can well avoid psychological damage and protect children's self-esteem.

30.3. Do you think negative feedback is more important than potitive feedback? Why?

Yes, I think so. Giving positive feedback makes the recipient feel good about themselves. Giving them negative feedback helps them see what they can improve. The impact of their ability to improve something bad they are doing is much bigger on their prospects of success than the impact of them continuing to do the positive things they are already doing. 

Well, I think either blind encouragement or constant criticism is wrong, which will have a negative impact on people. Take educating children as an example, excessive or inappropriate positive feedback is actually a kind of indulgence. Some parents always teach their children through encouragement. As a result, children in a certain stage may behave self-righteous, lack self-control, and deviate from a clear recognition of self-orientation. However, too much negative feedback will make children doubt themselves when they are faced with complex situations. Therefore, I believe both negative feedback and positive feedback are equally important. We should use them appropriately depending on the situation.

30.4. Why is negative feedback as important as positive feedback at work or in study?

I think it is because only the combination of positive feedback and negative feedback can keep people on the right direction in their work or study. Take shopping online as an example: today, consumers are more enthusiastic about shopping online, but since they can't experience products or services themselves before buying, many consumers check reviews and feedback before placing an order. For consumers and sellers, users’
feedback plays a huge role. Consumers can obtain information from the feedback of other users' reviews to learn about their positive or negative feelings about products and services. For sellers, positive reviews can actually promote the goods, and negative reviews allow them to realize the problems of the products and improve them in time.
