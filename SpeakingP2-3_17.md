Part 2

17.   Describe a story or novel you have read that you found interesting. 

You should say:
When you read it
What the story or novel was about
Who wrote it
And explain why it was interesting

I would like to talk about my favorite classic novel called The Godfather, which is written by a well-known Italian author, Mario Puzo. I came across this novel when I was trying to find a dictionary at a bookstore. It was published in hard-cover version and there was a colourful illustration on the front which caught my eye.

At first, although I was not much impressed by the novel’s preview, I still bought it and started to read the story right after getting home. Surprisingly, the more I read “The Godfather”, the more it appealed to me. This novel told the story of an Italian imaginary character named Vito Corleone, who was a mafia boss in America after World War I. What attracted me in this story was the way the author described Vito’s tricks to survive in a chaotic society. Thanks to this novel, I learned a lot about the course of American history in that lawless period.

After finishing this book, I read some more novels by Mario Puzo and they were all fascinating. I realize that reading books is a good way to gain knowledge; therefore, everyone should get into the habit of reading.

17.1 How does technology help people tell stories?

With so many digital tools at our disposal, we can now create multimedia stories that are more engaging and powerful than ever before. Digital storytelling is the use of digital media to tell a story. It's a way of using technology to create an immersive experience that can transport the viewer into another world. Digital storytelling can take many different non-traditional story forms, but it always involves using digital tools to create a narrative.

17.2 Do you prefer to read e-books or printed books?

Ebooks represent innovation, portability and technological concepts that apply to how the people from this generation are reading. For some people, it is more convenient to read these since we don’t have to carry more heavy stuff in our bag packs. We just have to turn on our tablets or phones, go to which ever application that support ebooks (iBooks or Amazon Kindle), and then start reading whatever we have in our library. Another very interesting fact is that we do not have to go bookstores anymore. Again, for some people this might seem such a waste of time because some bookstores are overwhelming packed with books. However, we can get all of the books that we want through the app without having to dedicate an specific time to go the bookstore.

17.3 Why are mystery novels so popular nowadays?

The mystery novel is one of the most popular genres in the world. Mystery readers are intelligent people. The mystery story appeals to their sense of curiosity. They enjoy action. So that's why it's getting more and more popular.

17.4 What kinds of novels are suitable for a film adaptation?
