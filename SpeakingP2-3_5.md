5.  Describe a difficult thing you did and succeeded. 

You should say:
What it was
How you overcame the difficulties
Whether you got help
And explain how you felt after you succeeded

There are ample things which people like to take in their day to day lives so I think some things are kind of difficult and something is a totally easy is a totally depend on situation and many of people like to face difficult situations in their life like to sort out with presence of mind sometimes they even stuck to find a resolution of that problem and here I would like to talk about the time which I found very difficulty so I remember vividly when I got the summer vacation from my college I had immense time and I need to spend my time in the kind of productivity after that I also got the assignment from my college so I was too happy when I got the assignment because it was my own favourite topic it was based on environmental issues even the note over there even I had numerous of thoughts in my mind when I am try to write on the paper I was stuck even my mind was when is doubt even I also lose all the ideas which I got on that and after that I also gave my contribution to find alternative over the Internet even I failed every time because a teacher strictly gave restrictions about content could not be copied from the Internet. So I was in a massive dilemma on how to get the complete project in the given time frame. So finally, I decided to get help from my elder brother, who wasn’t available because he was busy with work. Moreover, it was a daunting time for me because I had never faced that situation. Afterwards, I tried to complete my assignment with unrealistic and uncompleted ideas. I knew it was not up to the mark, and I used my imagination power. Unfortunately, my imagination is not quite strong. Finally, I wasted my three days, and I had only two days even though my whole body’s gonna shivering badly. After sleepiness nights, I did my project on the environment and submitted it to the online portal. Unfortunately, the Internet was not working correctly, so I immediately visited my friend’s house. And due to the low connection, it took almost 5 hours to submit all the details correctly. So that was the time when I faced immense problems.

Part 3

5.1 Should people set goals for themselves?

Yes, of course. All successful people set goals, so goal setting must be a worthwhile activity to do. One on the main reasons why people set goals is because goals focus the mind and give it something to work towards. Goals are therefore like having a destination in life, and the things you do to achieve those goals are how you get there. Without goals you will have no destination to go to, and so will be blown around like a leaf in the wind, never really going anywhere.

5.2 How would you define success?

Each person has its own idea of success. It depends on our present situation, on our role models, upbringing, and how we see the world around us. And also on the limitations we set for ourselves. And while most people measure success in terms of money and possession, there are certainly individuals (or even organizations, and many of them) who have completely different criteria. Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.

5.3 How can we judge whether young people are successful nowadays?

I think it's common in my country that success is measured based on how much money people earn. If a person has a lot of money and properties, he is definitely considered a successful person. I think there are no differences in other countries. When you search for the list of the most successful people in the world, the results you get are likely to be the names of rich businessmen.

Undoubtedly, different person holds different views about success. I guess the majority people would consider success equal money, fame, reputation, and high social status. But I do know some people who pursue different kinds of things, for example, some scholars, they would regard the success as one tiny bit of development in knowing more about the world, in exploring more about the knowledge boundary of human beings. For me, one common creature of a million, I think success means going to bed with this sense of achievement and fulfillment every single day.

5.4 Are successful people often lonely?

Successful people see things, always see more thoroughly than the average person. However, once these things are thoroughly seen, there is nothing interesting to speak of, since he has already known the results, there is nothing worth him to do, so successful people, will be more lonely. Successful people's heart is lonely, because the road to success is lonely, the premise of success is that the heart should be strong and lonely, reached the peak, will lose the pursuit, reached the peak no longer rely on, of course, is lonely.
