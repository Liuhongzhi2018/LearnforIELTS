# Lesson 7

口语 Part 1

6. Home & Accommodation

6.1 What kind of housing/accommodation would you like to live in?

Honestly speaking, I prefer a house over an apartment as a place to live in. However, due to increasing housing and accommodation demands, owning or renting a house in the city centre is really impossible. So for the time being, we are happy with the apartment we live in. But if I have a choice, I would relocate to a town and own a large house with a beautiful lawn in front of it.

6.2 Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?

I prefer to live in a house. Flats are ideal for young couples and single people. But if you are on a high floor, getting your furniture in can be a pain, and there are sometimes communal maintenance charges. Flats are easier to keep clean but can get a bit claustrophobic if you have too much stuff in them.

6.3 Can you describe the place where you live?

Well, I live in a high-rise building where the facilities are good in urban area. There are air-conditioning and voice-controlled doors in the building. However, people who live here rarely communicate with their neighbours and they’re quite indifferent to each other.
