# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

25.   Watch

25.1 Do you wear a watch?

Well, in senior high, I used to wear a watch for the sake of time, especially in examinations.
And the watch was used to keep an eye on time back then. But currently I use my smartphone for the time.

25.2 Have you ever got a watch as a gift?

I don’t think so. I have never received a watch from my parents nor from my friends.
Because I'm not a typical watch person, meaning others hardly ever see me wearing a watch. So that's the reason why they haven’t given me a watch as a gift.

25.3 Why do some people wear expensive watches?

The most important reason why someone wants to wear a luxury timepiece is to demonstrate that they can afford it. They use it to show off their wealth and perhaps social status.

This is because some brands are a symbol of their social status and wealth. The price of such watch is exorbitantly high so that it is difficult for ordinary people to afford.
So for those who want to label themselves by luxurious items, they may choose watch that can give them a sense of taste.

25.4 Do you think it is important to wear a watch? Why?

I don't think so. As I've mentioned, I reckon a watch is somehow obsolete for some people, meaning they can have their smart phones for replacement. But for some special jobs, like for doctors, I suppose, watch is still significant.
