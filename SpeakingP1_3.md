口语 Part 1

3. Weather

3.1 What's the weather like where you live?

Where I live has pretty consistent weather. It’s usually warm in the summer and cold in the winter. Sometimes there can be dry spells, but we get a normal amount of rain and snow. I like that we go through all the seasons. It’s nice to have a change every once in a while.

3.2 Do you prefer cold or hot weather?

My favorite season is winter. I usually enjoy snowflakes and play snowballs. I like to take a hot spring bath or make a massage in winter. Well, that would be fantastic. Summer sucks here because of the stupid hot weather; you can't play sports without sweating buckets.

3.3 Do you prefer dry or wet weather?

I prefer the wet weather. In my hometown, the weather is pretty wet, and it always rains in summer. So I think I've adapted to this climate. So being hot and humid weather does not bother me and it means that I can appreciate the beauty of rain and the lovely sound it makes. Furthermore, dry weather can also be often unbearable which I do not like. 

3.4 Are you in the habit of the checking the weather forecast? When/How often?

Yes, I am. Yeah, I formed the habit of checking the weather forecast when I was a primary school student, so now, every day before I go to work, I just check the updating info on my cellphone. And when I hang out with my friends on weekends, I will definitely attach much importance to the weather forecast. You know, it’s gonna be a disappointment if we are soaked.

3.5 What do you think are the effects of climate change in recent years?

A key effect of climate change is extreme weather. Rising temperatures cause heatwaves droughts, and wildfires. They also warm the atmosphere, increasing moisture. Higher average global temperatures are also melting ice at the polar regions and in glaciers in mountainous regions. 

3.6 Would you like to visit other cities that have different climates from where you live?

I would not. Because if the climate in other cities is too different, it will take me time to get used to it. I've adapted to one climate where I live and it's hard to adapt to a different climate quickly.

3.7 what kind of weather do you like most?

My favourite kind of weather would definitely be a warm spring afternoon with a light breeze. I like weather that is temperate and mild, the kind of weather you can lay down in and relax. I perfer such weather to wind, rain and snow. Because I like to spend my time outdoors and there kinds of weather prevent me from doing that.

3.8 Do you think the weather can affect people's moods?

Yeah it definitely can. Some people have a thing called seasonal depression where for example, during the winter months they are depressed throughout that whole period but they get better when spring comes along.
