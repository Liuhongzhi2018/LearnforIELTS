# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

15.   Singing 

15.1  Do you like singing? Why?

Actually, there are many kinds. You know, nuts and cereals are my favorite. I just can’t say no to the pistachios, cashews, walnuts and something like that, so sometimes I choose the bag of mixed nuts. And I just prefer to have cereals with some yoghurt, like two or three times a week.

I like to have some yoghurt, nuts or fruits between meals like blueberries, mangos, oranges. I don’t eat sweets or cakes much because they’re high in calories. Too much intake of these snacks will lead to obesity easily. I don’t want to put on too much weight.

15.2 Did you often eat snacks when you were young?

Yeah, because no one is gonna resist the temptation from those yummy food, especially the chips and those lovely sweets. I still remember the flavor of a kind of sweet, which tasted extremely sour, like preserved plums. Well, I should say, back then I was totally obsessed with it.

Yes, when I was a kid, I had a sweet tooth. I used to eat a lot of candies, chocolate bars, cakes and et al. As a result, I had serious tooth decay, and I remember what a nightmare it was every time when I went to the dentist.

15.3 When do you usually eat snacks now?

In most cases, I eat some nuts before I go to the gym because it's said that almonds are good for muscle recovering and building. And I also eat some dark chocolate when I don't have time to eat meals. It can put my mind at ease and I really love its bitterness.

Normally in the late afternoon when I feel groggy and lack of energy, I would have some refreshments to recharge my batteries. And also after working out in the gym, I'll eat a protein bar or have some carbs.

It depends what I've been eating and what my schedule is like, but my blood sugar issues can require me to eat something every two to three hours. I'm more likely to need a snack between breakfast and lunch than between lunch and dinner.

15.4 Do you think it is healthy for you to eat snacks?

Well to my knowledge, most snacks are over processed, so it's definitely not so healthy for me to eat a lot of them or eat those kinds of food frequently. I tend to have some in my spare time, just eat in moderation. After all, snacks taste good and they can also put me in a good mood.

Most snacks people eat are high in calories in sugars, and they often contain substantial amounts of preservatives and additives. You have to be really careful to choose snacks that are healthy if you want a balanced diet.

15.5 What is your favourite snack?

A snack I really enjoy (although not the healthiest) has to be salt and vinegar chips. Honestly, anything generally sour is wonderful, as a kid I used to eat lemons right off the tree. Apart from this, I love hummus and crackers, fresh veggies, and anything baked or homemade.

15.6 What kind of snack is popular in your country?

Well, there are loads of snacks and street eats in China. Trying Chinese snacks will bring you a great eating experience. There are some popular names of Chinese snacks that won't let you down is baked sweet potatoes, stinky tofu, duck neck, etc.
