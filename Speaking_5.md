To get up to = to do an activity
I like doing 
I like to do -> it's a choice or habit
I'm fond of (I'm into / I'm passionate about) playing video games.

Q: Talk about your hobby.
A: I often paint. I decided to have a go at painting because my daughter was taking classes yeah, so, I've been painting for about 2 years now.

I often (regularly / frequently) paint. I paint whenever I can (as often as I can / whenever I get a chance). I don't paint as much as I would like. I don't get round to painting as much as I would like.

I recently took up painting. I started painting a couple of years ago. I decided to have a go at painting. I decided to try my hand at painting.

I've been playing football for as long as I can remember (donkey's years).

To take up a hobby = to start a hobby
I am new to 
have a go sth. = try sth. new

Q: The benefits of hobbies.
A: It (just) helps me unwind (kick back / chill out). I find that it helps me get into shape (keep fit / stay in shape). It allows me to (just) hang out with friends (meet up with friends / chill out with friends). It's quite a nice way to get close to nature. It has a calming effect. It's really therapeutic. It's a great stree buster. 

To relax
To stay healthy
To socialise

## Your family

Q: What's your family like?
A: I come from a big (small) family. I was an only child. 

Model answer: I am from a medium-sized family, I was the youngest child of three siblings. I think all three of us are quite different. We certainly have our ups and downs, and although we do fall out sometimes, we usually make up. Unfortunately I don't see a lot of them because I live abroad, but that said, we do stay in touch with Whats app. Talking about my parents, I take after my Dad, and actually I am also the spitting image of him. I would say, I have my mother's love of cooking, but unfortunately she passed away many years ago. Of course, I am married now and I have been for around 20 years and we have a daughter who is fifteen. To be honest, my wife and I are like chalk and cheese, but I think it's the differences that make our relationship interesting, and certainly keep us on our toes. Between you and me, my wife likes to be in control, and I think I am mister laid-back. I am much more relaxed and easy-going, but all in all we compliment each other. As for our daughter, well she is a mix of both of us in a way, but I would say undoubtedly, she is much smarter and better looking than the pair of us.

I look like (take after) my father (mother). My parents brought me up with good values.

There was a lot of sibling rivalry in my family. 
My family has 5 family members -> There are 5 of us in my family.
nuclear family 
extended family
My brother (sister) and I are like 2 peas in a pod. (similar)
My brother and I are like chalk and cheese. (different) 

We have our ups and downs
We don't always see eye to eye. Sometimes, we fall out but then we make up.
To fall out = to argue and no longer talk.

We are a close (tightly knit) family. I love my family to bits. My family mean the world to me.

It was love at first sight. 
I fell for her instantly.
We just clicked.

We've grown to love each other over time.
We've grown closer and closer over the years.

Blood is thicker than water = family is more important than friends.
