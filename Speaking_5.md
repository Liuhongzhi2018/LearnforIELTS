A: I get up to a lot of different things. I don't get up to much. I like to do yoga. playing video games. I like to dabble in cooking. I sometimes dabble in painting. I play the guitar (for fun), but I am just an aficionado (an amateur). 

To get up to = to do an activity
I like doing 
I like to do -> it's a choice or habit
I'm fond of (I'm into / I'm passionate about) playing video games.

Q: Talk about your hobby.
A: I often paint. I decided to have a go at painting because my daughter was taking classes yeah, so, I've been painting for about 2 years now.

I often (regularly / frequently) paint. I paint whenever I can (as often as I can / whenever I get a chance). I don't paint as much as I would like. I don't get round to painting as much as I would like.

I recently took up painting. I started painting a couple of years ago. I decided to have a go at painting. I decided to try my hand at painting.

I've been playing football for as long as I can remember (donkey's years).

To take up a hobby = to start a hobby
I am new to 
have a go sth. = try sth. new

Q: The benefits of hobbies.
A: It (just) helps me unwind (kick back / chill out). I find that it helps me get into shape (keep fit / stay in shape). It allows me to (just) hang out with friends (meet up with friends / chill out with friends). It's quite a nice way to get close to nature. It has a calming effect. It's really therapeutic. It's a great stree buster.
