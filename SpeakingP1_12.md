口语 Part 1

12.  Public transportation 

12.1  What kind of public transportation do you usually take?

I usually take public transportation, such as bus, subway and shared bike. Because public transportation is much more convenient for me and friendly to environment.

Most of the time I use the subway system for getting about in the city as it's cheap, reliable and isn't affected by traffic jams or other unforeseen delays. Also, the number of lines and stations means the metropolitan area is pretty well covered by the network. Now and again I'll take a bus if it's absolutely necessary. They tend to be cramped, stuffy and can easily get stuck in traffic jams during rush hour, so they aren't my first preference.

12.2 When do you usually take public transportation, in your everyday life of when you are travelling?

I usually take public transport each morning and evening on weekdays, to go to the office to work. And, on weekends I take public transport if I need to go somewhere to meet family and friends – I'll take a taxi if it's not convenient to get a bus or subway. Occasionally I take a hire-bike from the street if the distance isn't too far.

Well，both. I usually take public transport on weekdays to commute. I'll take a taxi if there is no traffic jam in the morning. As for travelling, I use anything available because while traveling I don't have much of a choice. Some people could rent a car, but I can't drive, so I will check some of the bus or subway lines in advance, and be prepared when in a new city.

12.3 Do most people prefer public transportation in your country?

Well, not really. I think most people find public transport in Chinese cities a bit overcrowded. Everyone would prefer to have their own car, in an ideal world. Though, public transport is very cheap, it's not always convenient.

I'm not sure. But, most of my friends and most young people would choose public transportation to get around because as we all know, a lot of cities in China are very congested and it is difficult to find a place to park.

12.4 Did you take public transportation when you were a kid?

Seldom. My parents had their own car, so when I was a kid, my parents drove me to and from school almost every day. I only took public transport when I was with my grandparents, as we used to go shopping in different markets.

12.5 Will there be more people taking public transportation in the future?

Yes, certainly. I think that taking public transportation can save people a lot of money. You know, usually driving people own vehicle to commute would cost enormous amounts of money because of high oil prices. Therefore, people will be more likely to choose public transportation that is cost effective and environmentally friendly.
