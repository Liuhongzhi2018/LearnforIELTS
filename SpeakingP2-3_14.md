Part 2

14. Describe a time when you needed to search for information. 

You should say:
What information you needed to search for 
When you searched for it
Where you searched for it
And explain why you needed to search for it

If reading without a “looking glass” for a person with eye problems is incomplete and inefficient, searching for important information in today’s world without using the internet has to be incomplete as well. And, I also figured it out when I was searching for some important information about a couple of years ago.

I never really like to travel during the wintertime for two reasons. The first reason is, of course, I don’t enjoy cold weather that much. The second reason is that the winter causes the visibility of roads to become low due to foggy weather, and I am never really comfortable riding on a vehicle when the road visibility is low because it increases the possibility of an accident. But, I really needed to travel during the wintertime about a couple of years ago, because I wanted to see my younger sister, who had just given birth to a beautiful baby girl.

Anyway, I could either travel by train or by bus, depending on how fast I wanted to reach my destination, as well as the “visibility” of the road due to the hazy weather condition. I tried to call both the bus authority and the train authority in order to get the necessary information, but, while they were able to tell me exactly how long it would take me to reach my destination, they couldn’t tell me anything specific about the “winter fog”. So, I decided to hit the internet to find the information on winter fogs of those places, through which my train or bus would pass, by checking the usual temperatures and humidity levels of those areas. Luckily, I learned what I needed to know after searching for about 20 minutes.

Anyway, after finding the needed information, I felt really happy and relieved as I was able to find rather quickly, comparing with other sources of information, that the weather condition was not that bad for a daylong travelling. Besides, I also felt that I could rely on the internet more often in order to find important information for the purpose of meeting our daily informational needs.

14.1 How can people search for information now?

In the 21st century, technology has made inroads in our lives. Due to that, many options are at our disposal to fetch information. The prominent source to gain knowledge is the Internet, where a beaucoup of websites and video platforms provide quality information at the click of a button.


14.2 What information can people get from television?

Television provides a lot of information. There are channels where you can find sufficient content related to science, sports, politics, entertainment and other domains.

You can also watch news channels to get the latest updates.

14.3 Do you think libraries are still important in the digital age?

I believe libraries still have a significant role in our society. First, libraries provide content in the forms of books, journals and newspapers.

Apart from this, they offer serenity, a must-have to study effectively.

14.4 Does the development of the Internet have any impact on some disadvantaged people?

There is no denying this conviction that technologies like the Internet provide unabated support to the disadvantaged, especially those from humble backgrounds. It has given them a platform to fetch new information at no cost and generated avenues for making more money through platforms like Youtube and Instagram.

For example, many unskilled persons earn their livelihood by offering services on platforms like Zomato and Swiggy, where basic knowledge of driving works like a charm for them and empowers them to make money.
