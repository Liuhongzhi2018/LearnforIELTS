Part 2

20.   Describe a disagreement you had with someone. 

You should say:
Who you had the disagreement with
What the disagreement was
What happened
And explain how you felt about it

Well, usually I don't like to have any argument with other people, but when it comes to this topic, the first that I experienced out of mind, it was something that happens when I was in university.

That was quite a long time ago, if I'm not mistaken, when I was a sophomore in the university at that time, the president of the Student Union and University wanted to make a new policy and he proposed that maybe our students should actually do some morning exercises, which is actually something extra.

Maybe they should go to the playgrounds. It's about 7 a.m. and probably run for about 30 minutes. Immediately, I know his intention was actually quite good because he feel like the students nowadays we don't have enough sufficient exercises. So health is the foundation of everything. So if you can do more exercises, it’s going to help us to be stronger and it can benefit us in the future.

However, at that time I cannot totally agree with him. So, in the meeting, I just also stated to my disagreement. We actually had a debate. My point is that it is not really that reasonable to do that.

First of all, the morning time is not the best time for people to do exercises, you know, if you are waking up at an early morning and did exercises, maybe when you go to classes you could be really sleepy and drowsy. Well, those of you in the class say what influence your study, you will feel extremely fatigued.

And another reason is that maybe the morning is not really healthy for us because sometimes we have smog issues. The air pollution was still quite serious, so it may lead to some health problems.

Last, but at least, I told him that I think our own freedom to do some extra, you know, exercises. Some people have to do this in the morning. Some people would like to do this in afternoon or evening. So I think they should not force us to do that at the same time.

So after some negotiation and the debate, finally he just decided to just dropped idea. So I feel like if you have some disagreement with someone is better for you to sit down and to have a peaceful conversation and talk. Maybe people will understand how you feel.


Part 3


20.1. What do you do if you disagree with someone?

when I disagree with someone, I adjust my communication styles to increase empathy and build a lot more patience when dealing with this situation. This way, no constant disagreements are popping out.

20.2. How can we stop an argument from escalating into a fight?

During an argument, the only thing we can realistically control is our own emotions and behaviors. Anger, guilt, and pride are overwhelming emotions which, if left unchecked will dominate the conversation and make us say things we ordinarily wouldn't. When we notice things heating up, stop for a moment and take a deep breath. Ask for a five-minute break to clear our head.

20.3. Who do you think should teach children to respect their teacher?

I think it is the parents who should teach their children that they should respect their teachers. Parents are the first teachers of their children, and their subtle and physical actions will influence the way their children behave.

20.4. What disagreements do parents and children usually have?

I think it is boundary conflict disagreement. This occurs when parents attempt to set limits with their children. Limits are an important part of creating structure for children. But, setting limits can create tension between parent and child, resulting in an emotional disconnect in the relationship. The key to staying in connection during these limit-setting interactions is to align parents with their child's primary emotional state.
