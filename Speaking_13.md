# Lesson 12

口语 Part 1

1.   Public transportation 

12.1  What kind of public transportation do you usually take?

I usually take public transportation, such as bus, subway and shared bike. Because public transportation is much more convenient for me and friendly to environment.

12.2 When do you usually take public transportation, in your everyday life of when you are travelling?

I usually take public transport each morning and evening on weekdays, to go to the office to work. And, on weekends I take public transport if I need to go somewhere to meet family and friends – I'll take a taxi if it's not convenient to get a bus or subway. Occasionally I take a hire-bike from the street if the distance isn't too far.

12.3 Do most people prefer public transportation in your country?

Well… not really. I think most people find public transport in Chinese cities a bit overcrowded. Everyone would prefer to have their own car, in an ideal world. Though, public transport is very cheap, it's not always convenient.
