Part 2

4.  Describe a time you made a decision to wait for something. 

You should say:
When it happened
What you waited for
Why you made the decision
And explain how you felt while waiting

The experience I am going to tell you about is that I waited at hte summit of a mountain on the edge of my city to appreciate the sunrise. It was on the 6th of October during the last national holiday. After writing paper for five days in a row, I was tired with this form of entertainment and desperately wanted to do something more interesting.
Before I went to bed, it suddenly occurred to me that why not go to the nearby mountain to watch a sunrise? It seemed that the last time I did this was in primary school when my teacher asked me to write an essay describing the process. So it must be a special experiment to see if the view had changed over all these days.

Only at the mountain could I get rid of the air pollution and the numerous high-rise buildings that would block my eyesight and prevent me from enjoying the incredible view. So although the sunrise happened at around 6 o'clock, I had to get up far earlier to cover the time consumed on the road and the climbing. After careful calculation, I decided to set out at 3 am.

I arrived at the summit at a quarter past 5, and several people were already waiting there. They seemed much more experienced than me, having brought heavy coats to shield the cold, whereas the only thing I could do was to keep moving to warm myself. 40 minutes later, the sunrise began, dyeing the clouds the the mist first gold and then bright red. It was the most extraordinary scenery I had ever seen inb the last decade. All the waiting and the cold I had endured were totally worth it, and I felt lucky I had made the decision.

Part 3

4.1 What do people in your country often do while waiting?

Nowadays most people spend time scrolling through social media applications on their phones while they are waiting for something. People like to be aware of the new trends and they also find such applications to be entertaining.

4.2 Why do some people like a slow-paced life?

I think some people just like to take things slow because they have a more relaxed and focused approach towards life. Unlike others they don't want to be in a rat race of earning more and more money, instead, they prefer to live in the moment and discover life as it is.

4.3 Is being patient good for people? Why?

Yes, patience is a virtue that every person should have these days. Lot many times we see people losing patience on simple matters and becoming angry which does not bring good for anyone. Being patient helps people stay calm in difficult situations and stay in control of their emotions, whereas impatient ones can easily lose emotional control and get into arguments

4.4 Are people less patient now than people in the past? Why?

Today's generation is definitely less patient as compared to people in the old times. With technological advancements, they have become accustomed to getting things instantly. For example, people can now book flight tickets, order food, or transfer money with just the click of a button. So, when they have to wait for something that would take more time than usual, it makes them really impatient.
