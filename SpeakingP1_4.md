4. Movies

4.1 What's your favourite movie?

To be honest, I’m a bit of film buff. I think it’s a best entertainer and stress buster for me, and I’ll definitely take this opportunity to talk about my favorite movie and that is, Like Stars on Earth.

I watched it roughly 2 months ago, as my friends recommended me to watch it. It’s a family movie, and it was a Sunday, so we decided to watch this movie on Netflix. This movie is of famous Bollywood personality, Aamir khan, who is actually my favorite as well.

This movie is about a little child, who is suffering from a very serious problem and it’s a very rare disease, known as Dyslexia. Because of that he could not read and write well. However, he is excellent at drawing and imagination, but the parents always force and compel the child, to do good in studies. Since he performs poorly, he often used to get punished by the teacher, as well as the parents. Fortunately, one day, a new teacher joins the school, he is actually Aamir khan, and he himself was suffering the same disease in his childhood. So, he figured out immediately that this child has a problem, and he tries to help him out and try to nurture his talent of drawing, and by the end of the movie, this child emerges as a best painter.

I think it is a wonderful movie, with a great message for the society that parents should not always compel their children to do good in studies only, they should try to nurture their talent because every child is unique in itself. Apart from the good storyline, I also like the comedy in the movie. There were times when we were getting emotional. So, overall, it was a wonderful movie with the best Indian music as well. So that’s why I’d definitely say that it’s the best movie and I also recommend others to watch it.
