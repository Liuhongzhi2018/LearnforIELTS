# Lesson 19

口语 Part 1

17.   Social media 

17.1  Do you or your friends like using social media?

Yes, we do. Social media allows us to connect with other like-minded individuals more easily, and at a faster pace, than ever before. It also helps us find new interests, while realizing that we might not be alone in our love of some particular topic or hobby. You might be the only fan of a particular band or TV show in your local, physical community (or, so you think), but social media can help you discover entire communities of fans with which you can connect. Plus, it gives you the ability to discover more opportunities for serving your community and others.

Yes, we do. It is pretty trendy among youngsters. We use it to stay in contact with our friends,especially those living in another city, keep track of the latest news, follow celebrities we are interested in, and learn about fashion. It is not exaggerated to say social media has become an integral part of our lives.

17.2  Do you think you or your friends use too much social media?

Yes, I think so. Whenever we get free time, we will grab our cell phones and scroll through social media to see if anyone has posted something interesting. And the platform will automatically recommend relevant content. Before we can realize we still have tasks on our hands, half an hour may have passed.

17.3  Do you want to work in social media? Why?

It is hard to say. It is said that employees of social media are provided with decent salaries and excellent welfare packages. But they are also under tremendous pressure and have to work overtime frequently. I am not sure I can adapt to this kind of life.

17.4 What's the most popular social media in China? Why?

It should be WeChat, where you can post pictures, videos, music, and texts and interact with friends. I guess this platform dominates social media because it has integrated so many functions, like payment, instant messages, voice and video calls, and entertainment. You just cannot live without it.
