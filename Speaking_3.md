# Lesson 3

## Make it personal

Is it necessary to take a nap every day?

Yeah, I do think so. （general）I believe that the better we rest at noon, the more energetic we will be in the afternoon. So it's really important to have forty winks after lunch. （make it personal）You know, I say it also because I do it on a daily basis. I always feel very drowsy around 3 o'clock if I don't take a nap.

energetic
have forty winks
on a daily basis
feel very drowsy

Do you think people will still write letters in the future?

Honestly, I don't suppose so. （general）First of all, it takes more time to write a handwritten letter than to write an email. Then, you have to wait a few days before whoever you're writing to gets the letter and that's why we call it snail mail. （make it personal）Personally, I only write emails and I've had this habit for many years. As far as I know, none of my friends still writes letters. So yeah, they will definitely be gone in the future.

Do you think children should learn to do some housework?

Yeah, definitely.（make it personal）When I was a kid, I always did chores around the house and my parents rewarded me with an allowance. （general）So I think it's a great opportunity to teach children about money and its value. They'll know money isn’t easily earned, so they can treasure it more. （general）Plus, it helps to make kids healthier too. Doing housework can be seen as a physical activity and （make it personal）I believe I was much healthier than a lot of couch potatoes just because I did it on a daily basis.

How do people usually make friends in your country?

Um, I think there are many ways to make friends, such as from work or school. Also, you can make from on social networking sites like Weibo and renren. Oh, they are the Chinese equivalents of twitter and facebook. In my case, I have a lot of friends that I met on Weibo.

Do you think that global warming will continue?

Well, I'm not an expert on global warming, but I suppose it will probably. I only think so because it’s been getting warmer these years and I guess perhaps it will keep being like this.


3. “Well, I don’t really know much about ..., but I suppose ...”

What kinds of jobs might stop when the season changes?
Well, I don’t really know much about seasonal jobs but I suppose farmers don't have to work in the winter, or at least in the north of China cause it's freezing cold and the crops don't grow. Plus, maybe fishers don't work either because all the rivers and lakes are frozen.

How would you describe a good friendship?

Well, off the top of my head, I think you should be able to trust each other. I mean, this is of great importance. （回顾过去）You know, I remember vividly that （时间）a couple of years ago, （人物/事件）a friend of mine said something bad about me behind my back. I had thought that we were best friends, （感受）but that really hurt my feelings. I felt I couldn't trust him anymore.

Do you bring gifts when you visit others?

I only bring a gift when I visit someone for the first time and what I bring depends on what that person is into. （回顾过去）For instance, last month, I visited a girl I had met at work. She invited us over for a DVD night and I just brought her a couple of DVDs that I liked.

visit someone for the first time
meet at work.
invite sb over (to sb's apartment)

Do you think you could be a teacher?

No, I don’t think so. You know, teachers need to be really patient, but honestly, I’m not like that. （反例）If I were a teacher, and if a student made a mistake over and over again, I guess I would just lose my temper. I don’t think such a person could be a good teacher.
