# Lesson 5 

## 雅思图表作文完成步骤

第一步：审题（2 min）
1. 要素1
   动态还是静态（静态图没有趋势）
2. 要素2，时态
   1时间，表示未来projected，predicted，likely
   2图标
   3题目（题目里的动词）
   图表作文永远不要使用进行时
3. 要素3，确定对象词
   不要乱替换，number 不能替换 amount，ratio 不能替换 proportion
4. 要素4，确定描述对象和对比对象（差异点越多越好）

第二步：写开头段（写1句）
1. 主语：line graph/chart, bar chart/graph, table/chart, pie chart/chart
2. 动词：show， compare+对象词，present/give+information/data，illustrate+change
3. 地点和时间信息：题目简单就具体写，题目具体就概括写（over a period of ... during the period ...）

第三步：写主体段（写6句）
1. 描述对象的先后顺序
   主体段第一句，一般写最高值（以最近时间的最高级为主）
   第二句，写和第一句相似点最多的值（比较高，趋势相同）
   一般不写最低值，因为最低值不重要
2. 熟悉句式
   动态图：1 对象词+动词，2 最高级+对象词，3 地点（或时间）+saw+趋势+对象词，4 there be + 
      上升的表达：increase, rise, grow, climb, surge, jump
      下降的表达：drop, decline, dip, fall, decrease
      加速：accelerate, at a faster pace, more deeply
      保持不变的表达：stood at, flat, levelled off, remained, stayed...
      超过：surpased, overtook, outnumber
      幅度的表达：dramatic, sharp, steep, remarkable, marked, significant, modest, slight, marginal,steady
   静态图:
      1 compare with （差距不大）
      2 in contrast to （差距不大）
      3 higher than
      4 followed by （好几个东西对比）
      5 while/whereas
      6 equal to, on a par with, the same as
      7 there was a small difference/narrow gap in ... there was a remarkable difference/wide gap in
3. 读数据
   数据多尽量归纳
   数据少尽量细节
   高达：up to, as high as
   大约：around, about, approximately, or so, some
   超过：over, more than
   低于：below, less than, nearly, almost
   仅仅：only, no more than
   范围：ranging from to, between and 
   分别是：respectively
   分数：one fifth, one quarter, one third, half, two thirds, three quaeters
4. 注意句子连接
   前后句有共同性：1 similarly, likewise, alse 2 similar, the same 
   前后句有不同：1 in contrast, by comparison 2 different, the opposite 3 surprisingly, interestingly, it is interesting to note that 
5. 注意分段（不要一长一短）
   1 单图对象少，按照对象分（2-3个）
   2 单图对象多，按照其他因素分（高低，趋势，性质）
   3 线图按照区间分（时间段，趋势类似）
   4 多图：对象词一样，当做单图来看
   5 多图：对象词不一样，按照图来分
6. 注意段落连接
   1 使用连接词 on the other hand等，或者比较
   2 体现对象词改变 with regards to, concerning, when it comes to
   3 表现图的不同 as shown in the second chart, it is clear from the second chart

第四步：写总结段（写1-2句）时间不够的情况下，总结段可以写在开头段之后再写主体段
1. 动态图
   1 趋势
   2 高低 （有可能用到while状语从句、比较句）
2. 静态图
   1 对比对象高低
   2 描述对象高低
3. 总结段不要做的事情
   1 不要出现数据
   2 不要写in conclusion, in a nutshell
   3 不要写的太长
   4 不要揣测原因，不要给建议，不要做预想


## 练习 waste

![chart1](https://github.com/Liuhongzhi2018/LearningforIELTS/blob/main/Figures/chart1.PNG)

The bar chart compares the percentage of waste that was recycled in a city during an 18-year period.

Glass was the most common type of recycled waste in 2000, nearly 50 percent, around three times higher than the level in 1992. The recycling of glass also experienced the fastest growth during this period. The proportion of recycled paper was the second highest in 2000, and this kind of waste saw a similar trend, rising from 18% or so to 30%. By comparison, the development in recycling the other two categories of waste is relatively limited. The percentage of recycled plastic was the highest in 1992, but there was a drop to around 12% in 1997, before an increase to over 21%. The recycling of cans only saw a marginal growth during this period, with the figures remaining lowest in both 1992 and 2000.

Overall, a larger proportion of waste was recycled in 2000 than in 1992, albeit to varying degrees. Glass and paper were more likely to be dealt with in environmentally responsible ways than cans and plastic.


## 练习 dwellings

![table1](https://github.com/Liuhongzhi2018/LearningforIELTS/blob/main/Figures/table1.PNG)

The chart compares people in three regions in Australia is terms of forms of accommodation over a five-year period.

Tasmania had the highest proportion of residents living in houses, despite a drop from 88 to 86. Victoria and NSW saw a similar trend for the proportion of people living in houses, dropping to 76% and 66% respectively. 

In contrast, there was a modest increase in the percentage of people who lived in apartments. The figures for Victoria and New South Wales rose to 12% and 15% respectively, while Tasmina had the lowest (9% in 2006).

While the proportion of house-dwelling people dropped, the interest in apartments grew. Despite these changes, the proportion of people living in houses was remarkably higher than the proportion of people choosing the other three types of accommodation combined.


## 练习 part-time employment

![chart2](https://github.com/Liuhongzhi2018/LearningforIELTS/blob/main/Figures/chart2.PNG)

The chart compares the rate of unemployment for young workers and the overall population of five European countries. 

Poland has the highest youth unemployment, at 37%, followed by Italy and Hungary (23% and 21% respectively). 17% of young people aged 15 to 24 in Germany failed to find work, more than twice the figure for Denmark (8%).

For the whole working population, Italy has the highest level of unemployment, at 18%, compared with 17% for Hungary.

Germany and Poland have a similar figure (15% and 14%), while Denmark has the lowest unemployment (only 3%).

Overall, Denmark has the lowest unemployment, either for the young workforce or for the entire working population, whereas the other four countries have similar figures (in spite of an extremely high level of youth unemployment in Poland). The proportion of unemployment young people is higher than overall unemployment in all these countries.
