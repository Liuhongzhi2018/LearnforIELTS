7. Hometown

7.1 What's (the name of) your hometown? Where is your hometown?

Well，I come from Qingdao. Situated in the south part of Shandong province, Qingdao is an incredibly beautiful seaside city with many moods and faces.

7.2 Is that a big city or a small place?

Well, actually, it’s a big place but not as big as Beijing.It is the capital of Shandong province.I like it because there're many famous tourist attractions in the city, so sometimes I can go around there to enjoy the campus life with relatives and friends.

7.3 Do you like your hometown?

Yes, I do. My hometown has a mild climate and is a great place to cool off in the summer. The scenery is beautiful, with red tiles and green trees and blue sea and blue sky, which attracts a lot of tourists every year. People can drink beer, taste seafood and enjoy delicious food with friends.

7.4 What do you like (most) abour your hometown?

My favourte site in our hometown is Zhanqiao Land Stage, which is in the gulf of Qingdao. It is 10 meters wide and 440 meters long. Standing on the south end of bridge in the sea is a  two-story pavilion called "Huilangge". Zhanqiao witnessed the history of Qingdao and is one of the most famous scenic spots. 

I think that as a tourist destination, it should preserve its own characteristics to attract the tourists. In addition, the food here is excellent. You can taste a lot of local snacks that cannot be tasted elsewhere. In sum, I believe my hometown is definitely worth a visit.

However, living in a top-tier city makes me under tremendous pressure. The pace of life is way faster compared with other cities. The traffic is a nightmare, especially during peak hours.
