Introduction - paraphrase the question

The two pictures compare the current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the same living space.

Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points

We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.

Details - 2 paragraphs, compare the lines

The most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieve by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current staircase and understair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.

To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.


## Vocabulary

paraphrase: current layout, plan to redesign, living space, central hall area, staircase, under-stair storage cupboard, a new set of winding stairs, the installation of some kitchen furniture.

verbs: design proposal, planned building work, the design proposal involves, when the building work has been done.

## island

The map shows the changes in an island, which is now a tourist attraction. The coastal line of the island is about 600 metres in length.

The island is surrounded by sea. While a beach is located on the western end of the island, some trees are scattered in the western and estern sides.

Tourism has led to some significant changes. A number of accommodation units are built surrounding those trees in the western part of the island. These facilities are connected with the beach, a site now open to swimmers, by a circular footpath. Another cluster of accommodation facilities is sited in the middle of the island next to trees, also linked by a footpath.

Between these two groups of accommdation units is a reception with a restaurant lying to the north. There is a vehicle track linking the restaurant and the reception with a T-shaped pier constructed on the southern end of the island, which is used for yaching.

In summary, the island has changed to cater for the needs of tourists, after the construction of these facilities, while the trees have been well preserved.
