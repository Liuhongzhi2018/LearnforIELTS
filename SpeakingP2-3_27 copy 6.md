Part 2

27.   Describe a traditional product in your country. 

You should say:
What it is
When you tried this product for the first time
What it is made of 
And explain how you feel about it

Well, I think zongzi is a traditional product in my country we have it every dragon ball festival. I first tried it when I was a kid. We all went to grandparents house for the festival at that time and my grandma made zongzi by herself.

She first mixed the meat and the sticky rice together and then she used the leaves to wrap them up and then a string to tie them up. So it was like a huge dumpling and then we boiled them in the water and when they were ready we removed the leaves and then ate it. It tasted very soft and sticky.


There were different kinds of flavors. You could put different stuffings like salty pork or soybeans. I really like the sweet ones and I remember at that time my grandmother also told me something interesting about this food. Actually, it was originated from a legendary story about a man called quyuan who was a minister in Asian china at that time when he heard that his country was defeated by another.

He was so devastated that he drowned himself into miluo river and local people made zongzi at that time, and threw them into the river in order to keep his body from the fish. So then we have the dragon ball festival to commemorate this great man today. We celebrate this festival by having zongzi and having boat race on the river. So I think zongzi is very traditional and it’s a symbol of Chinese history and culture.

Part 3

27.1. Why are traditional products important?

I suppose there are two main reasons. Traditional products are normally handed down from generation to generation. People rarely use chemicals or other dangerous substances when making items, which is eco-friendly and beneficial to our life. Traditional products are a constant reminder of slow and green life. Another reason is that traditional products help us understand the history of the people who made them and their significance. Each culture has its products. For maintaining culture these types of products are really very important since people may come to know different things from them.

Traditional products can represent a country. When people think about a nation, they usually associate it with crafts, music, food, or anything else the country is famous for. This can build an international image, bring tourists, prompt respect, and encourage investments, as people fall in love with that particular country.

In many cases, traditional items, crafts, and food can unite a country, race, or ethnicity. This shared common culture between them, makes them feel like a part of one big family, where they share these common customs and traditions. This also creates a stronger sense of national pride and admiration, which in turn forms a national identity.

27.2. Do you think tradition is important for a country? Why?

I think most traditions are important for a country. Traditions can be regarded as a part of the culture and the history, Each country must have its own traditions that can represent its race to the world. In today’s civilized world, having traditions is quite significant. Nowadays, we find various races of people and their different traditions, which contributes to the diversity of our world. Of course, some traditions may not be suitable for social development, so they become less important and gradually disappear.

In our generation, it is very easy for a country to lose its sense of uniqueness. With globalization and the introduction of global brands to everyday life, a country could become all about Mcdonald's, Starbucks, and Walmart. Traditions can act as a defense against the loss of uniqueness.

A country without its own special customs, traditions, and culture can become lost, without any purpose and independent view of the world. This can homogenize the people in that country, acting and behaving as if they belong to another foreign nation, and that could be offputting for those much less interested in that globalized vision. In fact, it could even lead to conflicts.

27.3. What are the traditional Chinese products?

Some of the festivals in China stand out, as there are so many items being made specifically at that time of the year. For instance, during Spring Festival, there are many red-colored products (red is the color for luck) that pop up everywhere in all shops and supermarkets. There are clothes, souvenirs, home decorations, lucky envelopes, you name it.

There are more traditional items related to other festivals like Mid Autumn Festival, Chingming, and others. Many of those items are actually food crafts that are made specifically at that time. For example, there are mooncakes, shaped in a circle and carved with traditional symbols for Mid Autumn Festival, or Zongzi (sticky rice dumplings in a leaf) during Dragonboat Festival.

27.4. Why is it important for children to learn about traditional products?

It is significant because learning about traditional products can help children develop a bond with their cultural identity. Children have an inquiring mind and they tend to be easily influenced by the latest fashion. Traditional products can give children a sense of belonging, first to their family, then perhaps to the community and their country. As social species, this is an essential step for children to feel they belong to a group, by understanding what this group is.

As no one is born with full knowledge of his or her country and traditions, yes, kids should learn about those. Often times modern parents make the mistake of ignoring these or letting their kids know stuff on their own, which is an ineffective method to educate their children. They should have a more active approach and explain to their sons or daughters the beauty of their culture.

There are ways to teach kids about traditions at home and in school. At home, parents could sit down and craft things with their kids. It may sound challenging at first, however, don't forget that nowadays there are millions of video guides online for anything. These moments could be educational, as well as a great bonding method for the family. As for school, there should be crafting or culture lessons in primary school.
