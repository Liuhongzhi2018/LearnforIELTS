40.   Describe a time you uesd your cellphone / smartphone to do something important. 

You should say:
What happened?

How important the Cellphone/Smartphone was?
Explain How you felt about the experience?

We are living in an era where every piece of information is readily available on our cell phones. With the rapid advancement in technology, smartphones have indeed become an important tool. So today, I would take this opportunity to talk about a time when I used my cell phone to search for important information.

I searched for information last year in October. And mainly, I was looked at product review websites. October is a month of the festive season in India and as such, I was looking to buy a new laptop. I checked out sites like Flipkart and Amazon to find deals but instead, they put me in a conundrum. There were so many MacBook models making it hard to select one.

So I opened another tab on my cell phone to browse PCmag, which is a great gadget review website, to help me out.

My old laptop screen was broken and I had a work emergency. Therefore I needed to search for a new one. Since I could not access the internet without a laptop, my smartphone somehow put me at ease. I had both e-commerce apps installed on my phone. And I ordered the laptop with scheduled delivery in 24 hours.

never gave a thought that a smartphone could be so useful in situations like these. People may now find the information they need at any time of the day or night thanks to cell phones. These searches are frequently for goods and services that users are interested in. Before smartphones, people like me had to physically visit the store, speak with a salesperson, and trust their salesperson's judgement in order to make a purchase.

So, that's all I had to say about a time when a smartphone came to my rescue to search for information.


Part 3

40.1. What do you usually do with a cellphone?

In addition to contacting and texting my buddies, I use my smartphone for a variety of other things. I use it to navigate around cities, watch Youtube videos, listen to music on Spotify, and play games like Solitaire.

Apart from this, I use it for photography as well.

40.2. What are the differences between young people and old people when using a cellphone?

Youngsters are born with a mobile device in their hands. So they would use their cell phones in a variety of ways, including internet browsing, gaming, utilising the GPS, and of course, making phone calls. However, the majority of elderly people only make phone calls on their cell phones.

40.3. Which one is more important, using a cellphone to make phone calls or to read messages?

I believe it actually boils down to individual choice. While some people prefer calling, others prefer chatting, which for them entails sending and receiving messages.

40.4 Do you think there should be a law to stop people from making phone calls in public?

Frankly speaking, I see a phone call put on the loudspeaker as a form of noise pollution that seriously undermines the ability to focus and pay attention. However, there can be instances when making calls is important, especially in an emergency. So a way forward could be to encourage individuals to put their phones down in a public place instead of an outright ban.
