Part 2

15.  Describe an important thing you learned (not at school or college). 

You should say:
What it was
When you learned it
How you learned it
And explain why it was import

Indeed, learning is life long process, and as an innovative person, I love to grab knowledge regarding every concept. Here, I would like to talk about an important thing I have learnt, not in school or college. That crucial thing is cooking. Actually, I have been interested in cooking since my childhood. So, I generally watch cooking videos on youtube and help my mother with kitchen chores.

I remember two months ago, there was my summer vacation. At that time, I was free from my academics. So I have decided to improve my culinary skills. As my mother gifted hand in cooking. She knows how to cook Italian, Chinese and Indian cuisines.

My mother recommended me to learn baking as its the most important part of cooking. So, I started to learn baking first, then I learnt to cook Indian food. Because I think that cooking is an integral part of every individual's life as food is the basic necessity of human being.

Moreover, I want to go overseas for my higher education, and having knowledge about cooking would be fruitful for me. Besides, I followed a few cookery channels on youtube, which helped me alot.

Within one month, I learned all ins and outs of cooking and felt on cloud nine. Now, I can prepare different cuisines, which would be quite delicious. Overall, this is the pivotal thing I have learned from home and social media.


Part 3

15.1 What can children learn from parents?

There are five fundamental things that children learn from their parents from an early age that will define their identity permanently. Being organized and clean is one of the first lessons children learn at an early age. This aspect is so important that even multiple species of animals teach their young how to groom by example since they instinctively relate it to survival or health. The same thing happens with us, humans – an orderly and clean environment provides health and peace of mind.


15.2 Do you think some children are well-behaved because they are influenced by their parents?

Yes, of course I do. Children are certainly influenced by their parents' words and success comes from teaching details.

15.3 Is it necessary for adults to learn new things?

Yes, it is. Not only can adults learn multiple new skills at the same time in the right environment and with the right beliefs, but doing so may improve their cognitive functioning considerably. Learning brought adults out of their comfort zones and made them feel fearless about new challenges.

15.4 How can people learn new things?

Learning without a goal is much more tiring. Knowing what we are learning for allows you to focus better, and subconsciously helps you to filter and search for information based on the goal and choose the most useful ones that will maximize the effect of learning.
