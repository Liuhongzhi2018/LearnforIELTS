16.   Describe an impressive English lesson you had and enjoyed. 

You should say:
What it was about
When you had it
What the teacher did
And why you enjoyed the lesson

Well, I would like to share with you about a really pleasant experience in an English class I had at my university.

During one of our grammar lessons, the regular teacher was sick so the school had to send in a teacher to cover her place. And the substitute teacher, Thomas Hall, delivered an amazing lecture in English about how he thinks we should all learn languages through watching films.

Throughout the two hours, he explained to us the process of learning a language and how films can serve as an effective way to immerse yourself in a language. Basic elements like vocabulary and grammar can be easily absorbed if we focus on dialog in a TV show, and so in the long run, our overall language skills can be improved. This method helps us to learn any language effortlessly and in a short period of time.

At first, we were all sceptical about the ideas he introduced, however, after watching a short video to practice and doing a trial test, we were all convinced that learning by watching movies was not hard at all and we could apply this to enhance our performance at school.

I enjoyed this lesson so much because I find this method to be particularly effective for me. I always felt unmotivated when learning by traditional methods and my results were never desirable. But when I tried learning English using my favourite movies, you know what? My English got better and better and very soon I was able to remember thousands of new words and write really complicated essays. Now, I can even proudly say that I’m an intermediate English learner.

16.1 Why do people learn foreign languages?

Studying a foreign language is not only a hobby but also a trend in modern society due to some undeniable advantages. Speaking more than one language can open up a world of employment opportunities for job seekers, especially if that language is widely used in a business context. You will be able to work for not only local but global corporates as well with decent salaries. In addition, being bilingual or multilingual will help extend your social network worldwide. You can establish deep connections and cross-cultural friendships with foreign co-workers or local people while travelling. Finally, your brain will benefit greatly from the learning activity itself. Research has shown that studying another language will alter your grey matter which helps to increase your brainpower.

It is important to learn a foreign language because it helps you connect with more people.As it is,today we do not belong to a big planet Earth;we belong to a small global village and to survive in this global village,it is necessary to be multilingual.For example,English is spoken in 86 countries.If you know English you can communicate with people of 86 countries.

16.2 What makes a good foreign language teacher?

Not only a language teacher in particular but educators in other areas should have certain skills and knowledge to successfully inspire and instruct their students. First and foremost, of course, deep knowledge and great education matter. It's often said that "a teacher is only as good as his knowledge is". People may not need academic degrees or certificates in other jobs or industries, but in education and training, they are solid proof to verify your professional qualifications. Furthermore, communication skill also plays an essential role. If one is an articulate and persuasive speaker, he will be able to convey his lectures with better results. Last but not least, a good sense of humour may be of great help to grab students' attention and interest.

16.3 Do you think grammar is important when learning foreign languages?

Yes, I do. However you may feel about grammar, it's essential to have a good grasp of it when learning a new language. It's crucial for developing a good foundation for language learning. It's undeniable that grammar is essential for language structure. Focusing on understanding grammar can be a language learning tool.

16.4 Is it interesting to be a foreign language teacher?

Yes, it is. A foreign language teacher doesn't only teach reading, writing, syntax, grammar and vocabulary in other languages, they are also advocates for foreign cultures.
