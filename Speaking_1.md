Are you a student or do you have a job?
I am a student in Southeast University and I major in computer science. I've been studying this for one year already, so there's another three years to go before I graduate.
(I have a job and I work as an Ielts speaking teacher. I've been doing this for five years already and I suppose this is gonna bee my life-long career.)

I live in the school dormitory. It's not a very spacious one, but since it's only four persons who live there, it's big enough.
