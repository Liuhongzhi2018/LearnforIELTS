Part 2

42.  Describe a difficult decision that you made and had a good result. 

You should say:
What the decision was
When you made that decision
Why it was difficult to make
And explain how you felt about the good result

I can’t recall one that I’ve made recently but if I flick back through my memories there are a plethora to choose from. The decision in question happened when I was still in secondary school, maybe 15 or 16 years old, a fresh-faced youth not wise yet to the world of work.

I’d taken on a part-time summer job during the holidays to make a bit of extra dosh at a local restaurant. They were happy to take me on board as they were a bit short-staffed and business was booming due to the inflflux of holiday makers. The hourly rate was pretty reasonable and I was excited to start making bank, that is, until, I realized I’d stumbled into the restaurant from hell.

At first, while I was still learning the ropes, it didn’t dawn on me that something was amiss but soon I was coming to realize that the place was a shambles. One never saw the manager without a large glass of wine in his hand and his management style reflflected his constant low-level of intoxication. He’d change the shift rota erratically and without telling me, then chastise me for missing shifts when I didn’t show up. I had to serve the guests food, clean the dining room and dishes, as well as serve behind the bar and this pushed me to breaking point. It was simply too much to put on one person. Furthermore, his mood could turn on a dime and occasionally he would go into a rage for no perceivable reason.

It posed the classic dilemma. Should I stick it out and take the money or quit and save my sanity? I mulled it over for a while, weighing up the pros and cons. It felt brilliant as a teen to have a wad of cash in pocket for the fifirst time, but I just couldn’t deal with the working environment so I decided to quit.

I was as diplomatic as possible when telling the manager and he took it fairly well. Upon leaving for the last time I felt like a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders and I’ve never regretted that decision since. Actually, I ended up getting a much more agreeable summer job in a quaint little cafe shortly afterwards, and more importantly it taught me a lesson about self-respect that I still remember to this day.

Part 3

42.1. What kinds of decisions do young people have to make?

Certainly less than their adult counterparts that's for sure, due to the fact that they don't usually need to fend for themselves in the same way as older people. Despite that there are still some pressing ones for young minds to consider.

Choosing a suitable career path is a biggie. Options for this are fairly open when one is still in primary school but the field narrows as one progresses through secondary school and university. Picking wisely to suit a person’s taste and aptitude isn’t an easy decision at all and it no doubt causes untold stress. Make the right one and a satisfying work life lies ahead, whereas the wrong one can land you in an unrewarding dead-end job without much hope of change.

On the lighter side, kids and teens get the ability to pick and try out different hobbies. Being unburdened from having to bring home the bacon, it frees them up to follow their interests and decide which ones they enjoy. For instance, when I was a lad I chose to take karate classes, ride dirt bikes and play guitar. I realize how fortunate I was to have such a legion of options to choose from and I appreciate it greatly nowadays.

The last one I'd like to talk about, dating, doesn't really apply to kids but it certainly does to teens and young adults. The tumultuous period of puberty is a time of classroom crushes, puppy love and heartbreak. I can’t think of a single peer in school, male or female, who wasn’t tied up in some kind of romantic obsession or relationship.This hormone fueled headspace can throw up big decisions like, ‘should I ask the girl I like on a date or just stay quiet?’. In retrospect this seems like a paltry problem but at the time it's life and death stuff. As a high schooler I had a number of dilemmas related to matters of the heart and it caused me both ecstasy and anguish in equal measures. I guess now I can see these as a sort of training ground for the adult relationships I’ve gone on to have.

42.2. Do you think young people are easily influenced by others when they make decisions? Why or why not?

Without a doubt, juveniles are kind of like a blank canvas in many ways as they’ve yet to become fully formed independent adults, leading them to be more malleable in decision making.

Parents are probably the largest source of influence for most children and can sway them this way or that pretty easily. Seeing as kids will almost always look to their parents for guidance, it make sense that they’ll mimic their mindset and this will be reflected in their life choices. Also, it’s a kind of natural psychological instinct to want to make one’s mum and dad proud, which can be done by choosing subjects or hobbies that they would approve of. On top of that, guardians are in a position of power over their charges so can literally veto or block any decisions they disapprove of. It’s a rather brute force approach but it’s undoubtedly effective.

The tables shift slightly though in one's teenage years and peers start to become more influential than they were in childhood. I’m sure we’ve all experienced this in our own adolescence. You want your friends and classmates to think you’re cool so you’ll consider their opinions more when making choices. I guess it’s mostly little things like what clothes to wear or what bands are cool to listen to rather than major decisions about life or career. Still though, it’s a noticeable source of influence.

In closing, while there may be a few rebellious young souls out there who are fiercely independent, I think the majority are pretty persuadable.

42.3. Do you think some people can make decisions without asking for advice from others?

There are definitely folk out there who can and I kind of envy them to be honest. I’m always second guessing myself and consulting a multitude of friends and family members before I make a tough choice. While it’s not a bad idea to get a second or third opinion sometimes, I wish I were a tad more self-confident.

Actually, one of my close friends called Scott is just this type of person. When faced with a dilemma, he seems to effortlessly pick a course of action without consulting anyone and confidently stick to it. To be fair, it’s not always the correct choice but most of the time he’s bang on the money. I’m kind of baffled by his mentality and would love a little sprinkle of his assertiveness, but alas, I’m plagued with self-doubt.

42.4. Do you think it's necessary for kids to make as many decisions by themselves as they can?

I reckon it’s beneficial to give them a degree of independence in their choices but if it goes too far it could end up being damaging. It must be a bit of a tricky tightrope to walk for parents and I’m glad I don’t currently have that responsibility.

Allowing kids a bit more agency can create confidence later in life. Children who’re allowed to make more decisions for themselves will have a greater awareness of the consequences of such choices, both good and bad. This should reduce the potential fear factor of facing vexing dilemmas when they grow up, therefore making more self-assured adults who won’t shy away from weighing up options and deciding.

However, giving youngsters a completely free reign over all their decisions might be step too far. A large percentage of kids lack discipline and maturity, so they may make choices that are detrimental to their health or life chances. Just image what would happen if you let a 5-year old come up with his or her own meal plan for the day. Ice cream for breakfast lunch and dinner isn’t exactly nourishing or nutritional. Now, I’m not saying every single little tyke would opt for such a sugar-rich diet but I reckon I probably would’ve have given the chance. Kids often choose the instant gratification option because their brains are still developing and they lack life experience. So, I believe they do need a bit of assistance in decision making while they’re growing. A mature guiding hand to ‘put some greens on their plate’ if you will.
