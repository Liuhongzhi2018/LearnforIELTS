26.   Describe something you do to keep fit and healthy. 

You should say:
What it is
When you do it
Who you do it with
Why it is important to keep fit and healthy
And explain why it can help you keep fit and healthy

Like everybody else, I like to stay healthy while also enjoying life at the same time. But, the problem is we can’t really enjoy life enough unless we also enjoy doing something healthy from time to time. Of course, different people enjoy doing different kinds of healthy activities, but as far as I am concerned, it is swimming.

I enjoy swimming. In fact, swimming was one of my most favourite hobbies when I was growing up as a child as I would hardly let any day pass by during the summertime without swimming, whether I was swimming in a lake or a big river. Besides, one of the greatest advantages of living in the countryside (yes, I grew up in the countryside until I started attending high school) of my country is that it almost certainly would have some natural lakes or rivers to invite those who would like to swim.

Of course, the difference is that when I was growing up as a child, I used to enjoy swimming just for the fun of it, but today, I do swimming because it helps me remain healthy. Besides, these days, I swim mostly in a local swimming pool as the city, in which I live now, doesn’t have many natural lakes, rivers or any ocean where I would be able to enjoy this activity better.

Anyway, I enjoy this healthy activity with a bunch of other guys (they are not related to me in any respect), and I do this every weekend if not more. By the way, I am trying to form a swimming club in my city in order to make swimming more of a fun activity rather than considering it as only a healthy activity.

Anyway, I think that swimming is a healthy activity because it forces each and every part of our bodies to engage in perfect sync with each other in order to keep us floating in the water. Besides, it also helps me relax after a long week of work by allowing me to forget about the worries of my daily life for a while.

Part 3

26.1. How do children and old people keep fit and healthy?

Children lead a generally active lifestyle, running around all the time, and using all their energy throughout the day. Many of them join different activities from playing outside on the playground to biking and even joining some sports teams. They are very active and energetic, as a whole.

The older a person gets, the less likely is that he will exercise. That doesn't mean that they completely give up though. Many older people would take long walks around their neighborhood or park, use some of the outdoor training equipment and even try to do more housework, in order to stay active.

26.2. What do young people normally do to keep fit and healthy in your country?

Generally, young people do the same as kids. They join some sports teams or make one with their buddies and play football, basketball, badminton and so on. Some would try to push even further and would sign up to a gym, where they would try to either keep fit or even build muscles and become a better version of themselves.

By a large margin, younger people do not exercise that much. As they are overwhelmed with studying from school and college, addicted to gaming and social media on their mobile phones, and stressed trying to be competitive once they start working, very few would have the time, patience, or motivation to work out at all. 

26.3. How can parents help and guide their kids to keep healthy??

Parents are the first teacher to their kids. They should sit with them and spend time with them, reading useful materials related to health like encyclopedias, and stories, watch video documentaries, and more. Children are like sponges and will absorb the information, after a while, and that information will turn into good healthy habits.

It is a well-known fact that children imitate and copy their parent's behavior. It is not certain, but often times if the parent smokes, kids will do the same if the parent is glued to his mobile phone, children will imitate the same, and so on. Parents should lead by their example, allowing their kids to imitate their healthy lifestyle choices and not the opposite.

26.4. Do you think it is good for the government to utilize popular celebrities to help build health awareness?

Celebrities have a large following on social media and other places. They are being seen and viewed, predominantly by younger people who still build their views about the world. These famous individuals have a moral obligation to promote and support health, health-related activities, and everything related to improving people's understanding of health.

The government has the power to set the rules, restrict individuals, ban certain unhealthy practices, punish wrongdoing, and more. This means that they are responsible to control celebrities and not the other way around. It is absolutely ridiculous that the most viewed and followed famous individuals advertise fast food, alcohol, drugs, and many other unhealthy behaviors, and are not regulated at all.
