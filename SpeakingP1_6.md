# Lesson 10

口语 Part 1

6. Home & Accommodation

6.1 Do you live in a house or a flat?

Because I am currently a student at school, I live in the school's apartment dormitory.

6.2 Can you describe the place where you live?

Well, I live in a high-rise building where the facilities are good in urban area. There are air-conditioning and voice-controlled doors in the building. However, people who live here rarely communicate with their neighbours and they’re quite indifferent to each other.

6.3 How long have you lived there?

I have been living in the school dormitory for more than a year.

6.4 Please describe the room you live in.

Our dormitory has four beds and is laid out with the beds on top and desks on the bottom. The room has a separate bathroom with a water heater in which we can shower. And we have a small balcony where we can dry our washed clothes.

6.5 What part of your home do you like the most?

To be honest, it's the sitting-room. With an exquisite tapestry suspending on the wall, the whole style makes me feel go back to middle age while smart TV with a large screen brings me return to the modern life.

My favourite part of my home is definitely the kitchen. I am very passionate about food and love to cook, so I like to spend lots of time in my kitchen learning new recipes and skills. My home has a big and very nice kitchen, so I always have a very enjoyable time when I am in that room.

6.6 Who do you live with?

I am currently living in a school dormitory with four roommates. And I've been living with my parents in our home since I was a child.

6.7 What room does your family spend most of the time in?

My family loves to stay in the living room as this is the only place in the flat where we can do a lot of things together. We play board games, watch films and TV programs. We play cards sometimes and we spend time working on huge puzzles together.

6.8 What do you usually do in your flat?

At weekends, I spend most of my time studying and sleeping in my room. On weekdays, I spend time in the kitchen, baking some cakes or sweet stuff for my mother. Sometimes, we watch films in the living room. On Sundays, we usually clean the house and do some laundry.

6.9 What kind of accommodation do you live in?

I live in a spacious apartment with the area of 170 square meters. To be more specific, it is a high-rise brick flat with 2 bedrooms in a housing estate in downtown. Behind our flats there lies a river and we can jog and take a walk along with it.


6.10 Do you plan to live there for a long time?

Not really. I want to blaze my own trail and live in a place that forces me to reach out and meet new people. I was thinking about moving to Shanghai for a few days to gain a bit more cultural experience of the world.

6.11 Do you prefer living in a house or a flat?

I prefer to live in a house. Flats are ideal for young couples and single people. But if you are on a high floor, getting your furniture in can be a pain, and there are sometimes communal maintenance charges. Flats are easier to keep clean but can get a bit claustrophobic if you have too much stuff in them.

6.12 Are the transport facilities to your home very good?

Honestly, I wish they were better. I have to walk 20 minutes to the bus stop, and the subway takes another 30 minutes when I get to work. My dream home is a house located right next to a bus stop or subway terminal.

6.13 What kind of house of flat do you want to live in in the future?

Well, I would prefer a new flat in the town center. It doesn't have to be very big, but definitely has to be nice and cozy. I'd like to have a big house with a beautiful garden In front for myself. You see, I always wanted to live in a house, to enjoy the big space and privacy it provides. But, of course, I also have to think in terms of my affordability before I make my final decision

6.14 What's your favourite room in your apartment/house?

I think it must be my bedroom. My bedroom is not that big but quite neat. There are some posters of Kobe Bryant on the wall because he is my favorite basketball player. My room is kind of a private space for me - I usually play some video games, do my homework and play the guitar in it.

6.15 What makes you feel pleasant in your home?

I think it must be my bedroom. My bedroom is not that big but quite neat. There are some posters of Kobe Bryant on the wall because he is my favorite basketball player. My room is kind of a private space for me and it makes me feel pleasant. I usually play some video games, do my homework and play the guitar in it.

6.16 What's the difference between where you are living now and where you have lived in the past?

I have not moved home at all. I have lived in the same flat since I was born. I love our small place. I have a lot of good memories here, and I treasure them. I'd happily stay here for many more years?

6.17 Do you think it is important to live in a comfortable environmnet?

Yes, I do. Living in a comfortable atmosphere avoids noise and allows people to rest and relax at ease.

6.18 What kind of housing/accommodation would you like to live in?

Honestly speaking, I prefer a house over an apartment as a place to live in. However, due to increasing housing and accommodation demands, owning or renting a house in the city centre is really impossible. So for the time being, we are happy with the apartment we live in. But if I have a choice, I would relocate to a town and own a large house with a beautiful lawn in front of it.
