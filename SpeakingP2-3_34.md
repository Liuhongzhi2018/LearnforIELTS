Part 2

34.   Describe something you do that can help you concentrate on work / study. 

You should say:
What it is
How it helps you concentrate
When you do it
And explain how you feel about it

By nature, I’m a type of guy who is easily distracted by the surroundings, and I especially detest noises, so today I’m going to tell you about a method I use that helps to maximize my concentration to its fullest. This method is placing a pair of earplugs into my ears every time I read something.

We’re now living in a time where there are noises from everywhere: car honking, deafening noises from construction sites like someone hammering on a piece of metal. Such noises can reduce your concentration and attention span, reducing work productivity to a great extent. To counter that problem, I bought a pair of earplugs, which did wonders to me is it has helped me to stay in complete silence without being disturbed by any sounds.

This method is particularly of use as earplugs are small and easily portable, so you can take them along with you to coffee shops where there are noises from conversations, or even on the plane where you can escape from the engine noises or short hearing impairment due to low atmospheric conditions. It seems like being alone and you can wholeheartedly focus on the task at hand. It has worked wonderfully for me and I would recommend having a try at it. rather than listening to background music which can even make you lose focus as some may be more engrossed into the music played.

Part 3

34.1. Why is it more difficult for children to concentrate nowadays than in the past?

There are many reasons why children these days are easily distracted. First, I guess the prevalence of the Internet has hindered their ability to focus on a particular subject because they can frequently scroll through different news and pictures without reading the content. Second, there are so many distractions nowadays either in their houses or at schools such as the game consoles that urge them to play more instead of focusing on their work. So these factors ultimately make them less likely to focus for a long time.

The significant causes of the absence of focus among kids in schools are rising noise and air pollutions, unhealthy dietsalong with computer games and inadequate parenting.

34.2. Do you think technology will harm children’s ability to concentrate?

Obviously. As I previously mentioned, the advent of social media and other technology has severely affected youngsters' concentration. I have read in an article that children’s attention span only lasts for about 7 minutes nowadays, and it specifically pointed out that this is because they were too distracted by their smartphones and gaming devices.


34.3. What kinds of jobs require high concentration at work?

There are multiple professions that require workers to be 'laser focused'. Those working in the data analysis sector of any corporation often find themselves surrounded by complicated data and codes, which the slightest mistake could be detrimental. Other occupations in the medical field such as surgeon also demand a great deal of concentration since they deal with the patients' safety.

34.4. Can exercise help people improve concentration?

Actually, I'm quite ambivalent about this. You see, for some, of course doing light exercise could help with blood circulation, which ultimately leads to a better attention span. This is especially true for office workers, who sit around all day next to their computers. However, for others, participating in physical activities only makes them even more tired because they have to spend extra energy doing them. Then, they'd probably find it hard to concentrate but rather go to sleep right afterward. So I guess it really depends on the individual, and on the kind of exercise.
