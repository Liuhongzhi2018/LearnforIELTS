30.   Collecting things

30.1 Do you collect things?

No, now I don't collect anything, because I am not very into any particular things. But when I was a kid, I used to collect stamps, because at that time, collecting stamps was the thing, so I was jumping on a bandwagon but later I did not find it interesting anymore.

30.2 Are there any things you keep from childhood?

I am afraid no, keeping something from childhood is just impossible for me, because I am not very organized, so basically, I am always losing my things or just forgetting where they are, so how can you expect a man like me’to keep something from childhood?

30.3 Would you keep old things for a long time? Why?

No, actually I am the kind of person who always would like to cut off and abandon meaningless things because I think few possessions mean more freedom.

30.4 Where do you usually keep things you need?

I usually keep my most important things and the things I use most often at hands such as small baskets or boxes. I create a place for almost everything and I don't like to leave things everywhere. Generally, everything I need has its own storage box because I want to keep things in order把. So, in this way, I find things more easily if I need them.
