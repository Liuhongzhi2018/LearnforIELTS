43.   Describe an important river / lake in your country. 

You should say:

And explain why it is important

I would like to talk about YangtzeRiver. It is one of the most important rivers in the world, and is also the longest river in China, the third-longest in the world. The river is about 6300 km long (3915 miles) and originates in a glacier lying on the eastern part of the Tibetan plateau.It passes through the spectacular Yangtze Gorges, which are noted for their natural beauty, and flows into the East China Sea. One of the dams on the river, Three Gorges Dam, is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world.

The river is one of the worlds busiest waterways. Traffic includes commercial traffic transporting bulk goods such as coal as well as manufactured goods and passengers. River cruises several days long, especially through the beautiful and scenic Three Gorges area, are also popular.

Many metropolis in China are located on its bank, like Wuhan, Chongqing and Nanjing. It plays an important role in agriculture and water transport.

43.1. How can lakes benefit local people?

Well, the way I see it, lakes are genuinely indispensable in our lives. They can provide us with prime opportunities for recreation, tourism, cottage and residential living. They bring huge cash flow to the local economy. They are also revered by many people for their local, historical and traditional values and may be a source of raw drinking potable water for a municipality like a tribe of Amazon Indians. Lakes can also be used as a water supply for industry and an irrigation source for agriculture. By and large, lakes are truly crucial to humans’ lives.

43.2. Do you think rivers attract tourists?

Without a doubt, natural water beauty spots such as rivers attract loads of tourists annually. This is primarily because travelers are dying to admire spectacular water scenery, get closer to nature and recharge their batteries. Playing water sports such as kayaking on rivers  is typically an exhilarating and invigorating experience for everyone. Marine and coastal tourism is considered one of the fastest growing areas within the world’s largest industry.

43.3. How do rivers/lakes affect local tourism?

Rivers/lakes can be tremendously beneficial for local tourism. In fact, fluvial tourism is thriving in numerous countries. These places are a paradise for water sports lovers and those who would like to embark on an adventurous journey to admire immaculate natural landscapes.This is genuinely a boon to local retail outlets, businesses, restaurants and hotels and travelers could greatly help tourism industry generate massive revenues for the local economy.

43.4. Are rivers/lakes good for transport? Why?

Undoubtedly, rivers could become authentic transportation routes for goods and services, and integrate with highways and railroads to transport merchandise effectively. Statistically speaking, the number of commodities transported by rivers the world over is rather substantial. Take Vietnam as an example, given this country’s long coastlines, goods are being transferred by rivers across the country. This has markedly promoted economic development and regional integration.
