Part 2

22.   Describe a time when you received money as a gift. 

You should say:
When it happened
Who gave you money
Why he/she gave you money
And explain how you used the money

Ok, giving a gift on some occasions, such as birthday, anniversary, wedding, is considered as one of the most important traditions in my country. I received special gifts many times, but here I'd like to talk about when I was always gifted in the form of money. It was my grandpa who constantly used to give me money as a gift.

I can vividly recall from my 6th birthday until 15th birthday, my grandpa used to give me money. Even though his intention of giving money was buying a gift as per my choice, I never spend spent it, rather I saved in order to buy something big for my grandpa. However, after saving money for a few years, he passed away and whatever I had thought all my plan ruined.

If I can understand him, I used to give me money as a gift because he could have thought that his chosen gift I will not like. Perhaps, his intention was to allow me for buying what I love. Or may because he might have thought that I need money for personal experiences. However, it wasn't the case, you know, all money that I saved I finally donated to welfare charity.

Overall, I can say that I will never forget my grandpa's gift how valuable was it for me. I will always remember his memories that he spent with me.

22.1. Why do people rarely use cash now?

Well, consumers are paying by credit cards or online payment methods because they are convenient and safe to use. Not to mention, many merchants nowadays don’t even take cash anymore.

I think this is the result of the prevalence of credit cards and digital payments, both of which are far more convenient than paying by cash. You just swipe your card during purchase or show the payment code on your phone instead of having to count out cash. In fact, a lot of hotels, airlines and rentals no longer accept cash for transactions.

Besides, there're many benefits of paying by credit card, such as building up a strong credit score and earning points and rewards like shopping discounts, hotel stays, and frequent flyer miles. With more and more people ditching bills and coins in favor of credit and digital payments, cash may disappear completely as a form of currency one day.

22.2. When do children begin to comprehend the value of money?

I have no idea, probably 5 to 6 years old when they begin to be given allowance? I mean by this age children should have become aware that one has to pay money for something before taking it out of the store. Before this, they might only understand the quantities of money but not their value. For example, they may mistaken that that two dimes worth more than a quarter. Then, if parents educate their kids the value of money and cost of goods at an early age, their children probably get the idea earlier than kids without such education.

22.3. Should parents reward children with money?

Yes. It's a good way to motivate children to do things like housework. At the same time, kids can learn about making money through working. It is also a good opportunity for parents to teach basic financial literacy, such as controlling spending and saving money for a rainy day.

Although some parents may think that rewarding kids with money will simply spoil them, I believe financial rewards actually work fairly well to encourage kids to repeat positive behaviors, such as completing chores and following rules, and these financial incentives can provide a great transition into money management and financial literacy.

For this to work, though, parents must know how to properly use these types of rewards. For example, rewards should be pre-planned and discussed in some detail before rolling them out, and any sort of reward should target a specific behavior or action the child performs. Also, financial rewards shouldn't be overused because when we incentivize everything, it becomes less effective.

22.4. Is it good and necessary to teach children to save money?

Yes, the concept of saving for a rainy day must be passed on to children from an early age. Teaching children how to save is an important step to help them become financially responsible adults. There's many benefits of teaching kids to save money. It helps children to understand the difference between 'needs', 'wants' and 'wishes'?

For example, the food they eat every day is a need whereas a shiny new bike is or a want and the latest tablet are wants that they need to save for. At the same time, it will instill the thoughts of goal setting – saving certain amounts of money as a goal to get what they want. Most importantly, they develop patience and discipline. Saving money will show them nothing is easily available, they need to earn it.
