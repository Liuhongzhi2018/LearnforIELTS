口语 Part 2 & Part 3

Part 2

9.  Describe a time when you forgot/missed an appointment. 

You should say:
What the appointment was for
Who you made it with
Why you forgot/missed it
And explain how you felt about the experience

Last month I went on a vacation to Xiamen with my friend. And one night we decided to go to a very famous restaurant there. It was so popular that we had to reserve a table in advance on the internet. So we were really excited about it.

In that evening when we were about to leave the hotel for the restaurant. It started to rain heavily. At first, I thought it may stop real soon so we waited. But after a while, it didn’t seem to stop at all. We will get late if we continued to wait so we had to take a taxi to go there.


Unfortunately, it was very hard to get a taxi on the street at that moment because of the bad weather and you know the peak hour as well. Finally, we got one and we told the driver to hurry up because our appointment at that restaurant was 6 pm and we had only 20 minutes left.

Unluckily, the driver had no idea about that restaurant and also because of the bad traffic he drove unexpectedly slow. So when we were still on the taxi the clock hit 6 pm, I had to call the restaurant to see whether they could hold the table for us a little bit longer. But you know since the restaurant was such a hot spot, the receptionist told me they could only hold it for 10 more minutes.

It was obviously impossible for us to do that at that moment. Finally, we missed that appointment and went to another restaurant. What a pity appointment it was.


Part 3

9.1 How do people who are busy remember things they need to do?

Busy people write everything down which they need to do. Writing information on paper can be very helpful, as it allows the brain to "see" the information, “process” the information as it is written, and refer back to it as necessary.

9.2 Do you think people should remember family history?

Knowing, recording, and preserving your family history directly impacts you, your family, and even future generations of people you may never know. Find out how and why family history matters. Marcus Garvey says, “A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.” Connecting with members of our family past and present by learning their history fills an innate need in each one of us.

9.3 If someone doesn't really like whom they are going to meet, they may deliberately miss their appointment. Is that true? why?

No, it isn't. Because an appointment is a promise that should not be broken because of the good or bad of the person you are about to meet.
